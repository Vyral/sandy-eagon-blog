There are a couple of great ways that you can be a hero around the Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner table.

When we talk with our clients and friends about how we can talk to their family and friends and be their real estate resource, I often hear something like, “My sister would be a great person you could help.” Other times, I hear something like, “Well, my cousin Bob might be interested, but you don’t want to work with him.”

We may be able to help your cousin Bob and **help you be a hero by being his real estate resource.**

Sometimes, we have family and friends who can be hard to please. Let me decide who I can best work with.

Since I work with them in a professional setting, I can be professional and let them know, “This is what I can do for you.” That helps them see what can happen and how we can get them there.

It doesn’t always mean that it’s going to be peaches and cream or that I’m going to be sitting around eating pizza with them on a Seahawks game day. However, I can make this transaction professional and make them feel good since we were able to get something done for them.

The first way you can be a hero is to tell your friend or relative, “You should talk to Sandy. She has helped a lot of people over the last 14 years and she can come up with a lot of great ideas to help you. She is a great person for you to talk to about real estate.”

The second is to tell them, “I’m going to have Sandy give you a call because Sandy has helped so many people in our area over the last 14 years. She is an expert and a resource. She’s patient and she will help you get through this process and get the result you are looking for.”

**Whether they need help buying or selling a home, introduce them to me**and let me decide whether or not they are too hard to work with. If I cannot help them, I’ll tell them up front. I don’t want them to spend a ton of energy and heartache on something that we both know isn’t going to work out.

That said, nine times out of 10, I do help them. Most of the time, I end up liking them in the process.

So if you have a cranky cousin or friend and you’re not sure they would get along with me, just give me a call. Those people need help, too, and I can help them.

As always, if you have any other questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you!
