We’re right in the middle of summer at the moment, so what does this mean for our market?&nbsp;

Well, **while the sun may be out and blazing, buyer activity isn’t quite as hot as what we’ve seen in the past.** There hasn’t been nearly as much competition lately, and sellers haven’t been able to pull in quite as many high offers as what was once the case.&nbsp;

What does this tell us? **As I’ve said in the past, you can’t time the market.** This past spring may have been our market’s peak, but we can’t say that for sure. We’ll have to wait to see how this fall and winter (and next spring) perform to get a better idea of how current conditions fit into larger market trends.

Instead of focusing on what’s happening in the market, though, I encourage you to take a look at what’s happening in your life. Do you have too many bedrooms? Are you looking to move to the city? Whatever the case is for you, let’s talk. **Let’s get together and develop a strategic plan for your needs.**&nbsp;

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
