Have you ever been curious about who our lenders use for their Realtors?

The truth is that everyone from our lenders, our title representatives, and our inspectors see a lot of agents each day.

Since they work so closely with so many agents, they’ve come to understand the difference between an agent who serves their clients and one who may not do so much.

Recently, one of my lenders sent me to his colleague who was looking to buy a duplex with her husband. The plan was for them to live in one side while close family lived in the other.

This sounded like an awesome plan, and it didn’t take long for us to find the right duplex for them.

Even though it was more than they could afford, we managed to strike a deal that worked within their budget. We won this battle because this lender knew me and my skills.

**When looking for an agent who can make a strong transaction, go to the person who other professionals are recommending.**

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
