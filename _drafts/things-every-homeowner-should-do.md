When you buy a home, the temptation is strong to grab the keys and move in already, but there are a few things you should take care of right away before you even start the process.

First, look at the keys. How many people have had access to the home before you owned it? The previous homeowner may have given spare keys to friends, family members, or anybody else really. **This is a good time to change those locks by either calling a locksmith and having them all keyed to a different key or going to buy new hardware and switching it out.**

Secondly, change out the air filter in the furnace. There were a lot of different smells with the previous homeowner, so make the home your own by breathing in that fresh air.

Finally, swap out the toilet seats. Get your own seats on there that are clean, look good, and don’t have any cracking paint or busted hinges.

After a while, you will get settled into daily life in the new home. However, that doesn’t mean you should neglect home maintenance in certain areas. Everyone forgets some of the things they should do on a regular basis, **so we have a quick list of things to share that you should keep up with regularly in your home.** Here they are:

1. Service the furnace by swapping out the previously mentioned air filter twice per year.

2. Take a look at your attic and crawlspaces for any water leaks, mold, or pest intrusion.

3. Vacuum those appliances. Pay attention to the refrigerator coils and underneath the oven. You use these things every day, so it’s smart to keep them clean, fresh, and working properly.

4. Flip your mattress. It’s just like rotating your tires. It will help you get more life out of your mattress, and probably a great night of sleep.
