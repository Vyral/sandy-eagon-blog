Does your house work for you in 2018?

Did you get a new puppy for Christmas and now you need to put up a fence? I have a post hole digger I’d be glad to share with you.

Check out [SandyAndCompanyVideos.com/Toolshed](/toolshed.html) and browse all the tools we’d let you use.

Sometimes you need a tool, but you don’t need to buy it, so let us be there for you if that’s your situation.

Is the project bigger than just having the right tool? Let me help you find that right plumber, contractor, etc. We’re the resource to help you find the right person for that job as well.

Speaking for myself, we’re finally adding our mud sink to the garage this year, so I’ll be calling the plumber to get that started this week.

Finally, have you had kids move out (or back in) this year and the size of your house needs to change? Give me a call so we can talk about what your home needs to be in order to work for you and your family.

As always, if you have any other questions or real estate needs, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I would love to help you. Until then, happy 2018 and have a super day!
