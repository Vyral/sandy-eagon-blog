I want to take a step away from the real estate market for a moment to talk about my darling Chloe. She graduated from community college last week. We're celebrating that big life step in our family.

When Chloe graduated from high school two years ago, she announced, “I think I want to open a bakery. If that doesn’t work, maybe I’ll go work for NASA.”

I asked, “Why don’t you go work for NASA and bake on the weekends?”

“Nah,” she replied, “I don’t want to do all of that really big math.”

Chloe is good at really big math problems, but having to do that all the time was just not her cup of tea. And she really loved to bake. So, she went to community college to study business administration and prepare to open the bakery. When she took her first accounting class, she realized how much accounting made sense for her.

**I am so proud of Chloe.** She just finished up at Everett Community College and she will move to the University of Washington Bothell campus in the fall.

These transitions give us opportunity. How great is it that we get to celebrate these awesome times in our family when we get to see growth? It’s so amazing that we get to see the people our children are becoming.

I am so excited for Chloe and her future. She’s made some awesome steps. She has been working for Chick-fil-A for the last year and before that she worked at Alfie’s. She's been so strong and responsible, and I am excited because her future is bright.

I hope that you take the time to talk to your own graduates and tell them how proud you are. After all, they’ve done something really big, whether they are graduating from some other school or training program. They are taking a step forward, making themselves better, and **working to be the best person they can be.**

This is the time of year to celebrate your family and friends’ accomplishments. So, I would like to take a minute to say:

Chloe, I am so proud of you. You are awesome. I couldn’t be more happy with the young lady you are today.

I hope you have an awesome day and remember, celebrate! Of course if you have any real estate questions, please be sure to reach out. I am happy to help you!
