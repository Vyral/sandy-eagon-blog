I want to take a step away from the real estate market for a moment to talk about my darling Chloe, who graduates from community college this month. We are celebrating that big life step in our family.

When Chloe graduated from high school two years ago, she said, “I think I want to open a bakery. If that doesn’t work, maybe I’ll go work for NASA.”

I said, “Why don’t you go work for NASA and bake on the weekends?”

“Nah,” said Chloe. “I don’t want to do all of that really big math.”
{: .present-before-paste}

Chloe is good at really big math problems, but having to do that all the time was just not her cup of tea, and she really loved to bake. So, she went to community college to study business administration and prepare to open the bakery. When she took her first accounting class, she found that this step really made sense for her.

**I am so proud of Chloe.**  She is totally open to looking at the different parts of her life, figuring out how to make things work, and she has found something that really makes sense for her. She just finished up at Everett Community College and she will move to the University of Washington Bothell campus in the fall.

These transitions give us the opportunity to look back at what has happened in the past and what will happen going forward. Sometimes, transitions can be rough, but how great is it that we get to celebrate these awesome times in our family when we get to see growth? It’s so amazing that we get to see the people our children are becoming.

I am so excited for Chloe and her future. She’s made some awesome steps. She has been working for Chik-fil-A for the last year and before that she worked at Alfie's. She is so strong and responsible, and I am so excited because her future is bright.

I hope that you take the time to talk to your own graduates and tell them how proud you are. After all, they’ve done something really big, whether they are graduating from some other school or training program. They are taking a step forward, making themselves better, and working to be the best person they can be.

This is the time of year to celebrate your family and friends’ accomplishments. So, I would like to take a minute to say:
{: .present-before-paste}

Chloe, I am so proud of you. You are awesome. I couldn’t be more happy with the young lady you are today.
{: .present-before-paste}

Now, I’m going to go tell her that in person.
{: .present-before-paste}

I hope you have an awesome day and remember, celebrate! In the meantime, if you have any real estate questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I would be happy to help you!
