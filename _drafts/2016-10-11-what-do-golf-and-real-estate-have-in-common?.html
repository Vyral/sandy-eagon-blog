It’s a relatively new hobby of mine, but I’ve had a really good time strengthening my game lately and thinking about how golf is like real estate. <br /><br />I’m kind of a project person, and golf has been a different experience for me because it’s different than my previous hobbies like quilting, gardening, or scrapbooking, where I could produce something tangible to show for myself. In golf, when I have a great score, I still feel like I’ve accomplished something, though. <br /><br />How does this relate to real estate?<b> Real estate has an end product as well.</b> Most of the time, you have a closing at the end—someone bought a house and someone sold a house. Whether you have a paycheck, a new home, or something off your shoulders that you don’t have to think about anymore, it’s a great thing to look back on.<i><br /></i></span></span></span></span><br /><span style="font-size: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span></span><br /><div class="quote-box"><span style="font-size: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><span class="quote quote-left">“</span></span></span><br /><div class="quote-text"><span style="font-size: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">In both golf and real estate, I can depend on feedback in order to get better.   </span></span></div><span style="font-size: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span></span><span style="font-size: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><span class="quote quote-right">”</span> </span></span></div><span style="font-size: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br />&nbsp;</span></span><br /><span style="font-size: normal;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">When I’m golfing and I make a mistake, I can ask for feedback from the people in my group to advise me on what I did wrong. In real estate, if an issue comes up, <span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">I have an amazing team that gives me feedback in order to help me determine the best way to serve the client.</span> It’s very much a group effort, but I still have something great to show for it at the end. <br /><br />As you may have seen from my Facebook post recently, I have decided to be on the budget model of golf. This doesn’t mean it will cost less money; it means I am simply getting every last pennies’ worth of value because I have so many strokes out there during the course of each game. <b>I’m going to enjoy it, appreciate the people around me, and learn from my mistakes. </b><br /><br />I was also fortunate enough to have been able to join golf and real estate in a literal sense when I sponsored a charity golf tournament this last summer for Leah’s Dream Foundation. Whenever I can put those two things together, I get the chance to know people, serve them, and have a great time. So, if I ever see you out on the golf course, don’t hesitate to come up and say a quick hello. <br /><br />In the meantime, if you’re looking to buy or sell real estate, don’t hesitate to give me a call or shoot me an email. I look forward to hearing from you!</span></span></span></span>
