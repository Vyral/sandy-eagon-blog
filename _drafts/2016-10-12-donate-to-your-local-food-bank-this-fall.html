The leaves start turning, the air gets crisp, and the holidays are just around the corner. When everything is groovy around you — the roof over your head is solid and your cupboards are full — it’s easy to think of the fall as a harvest time, a time of ample supply. Unfortunately, that is not the case for everyone. <br /><br />In the Marysville community, we have a large population of people who are either hungry or on the verge of hunger. This is true in every community, including Everett, Stanwood, and Lake Stevens. Jesus said that the poor will always be with you, but we don’t want them to be the same people all the time. It’s really important to make sure that we do what we can as the hands and the feet of Jesus, caring for our neighbors. <br /><br />Jesus also said that when you give out a cup of water in His name, you are giving it to Him. We need to help our communities in tangible ways. <b>October is the food drive month for Realtors,</b> and that’s why I’m sending you this. If you can, please drop off food or cash donations to our office and we will deliver them to the Marysville Food Bank. I can even swing by and pick up your donations from you.&nbsp;</span></span><br /><span style="font-size: NORMAL;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span></span><span style="font-size: NORMAL;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">If you are not from Marysville but would like to support the food bank, let me know. I can put you in touch with someone either in Marysville or in your own community. Remember, it’s important to give where you live. <br /></span></span><br /><div class="quote-box"><span style="font-size: NORMAL;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><span class="quote quote-left">“</span></span></span><br /><div class="quote-text"><span style="font-size: NORMAL;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">Let’s be good neighbors to each other.   </span></span></div><span style="font-size: NORMAL;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span></span><span style="font-size: NORMAL;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><span class="quote quote-right">”</span> </span></span></div><span style="font-size: NORMAL;"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"> <br />One reason the food bank is so near to my heart is that when I was a child, we often got those baskets of food. We got the commodity cheese, powdered scrambled eggs, and powdered milk from the government. I didn’t even like real milk when I first tried it because I wasn’t used to it. It’s very important to me that when I am experiencing abundance that I give back as well. <b>Please help us be a resource for others. </b><br /><br />If you are on the other side of this — if you are struggling right now, please let me know. I can put you in touch with someone who can help you. The Everett Gospel Mission not only helps people with housing, they will also give you a bag of food. They even have a little store that you can walk through complete with household items, clothes, and food that you can have for free.<br /><br />So this fall, let’s be good neighbors to each other. If you are my neighbor and you need help, please open up. I am here to help you. At Keller Williams, we are a team. TEAM stands for Together Everyone Achieves More. Let’s work together to put food on the table for our neighbors and make our community a great place to live. <br /><br />Again, if you have any donations for our food bank, just drop them off at our office at 1027 State Ave #102 in Marysville. If you can't make the trip, let me know and I will collect the donations for you. I look forward to hearing from you!</span></span>
