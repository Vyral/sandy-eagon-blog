That means, basically, rolling the profit you’d make from that sale directly into your next purchase.<br /><br />In our market, it’s the perfect time to sell. Is it the perfect time to buy for an investment property, though?<br /><br />Let’s say you sell a 1,500 square foot house and buy a 2,500 square foot house. Then, let’s say you sold that slightly bigger house and bought a duplex. With those three purchases, <b>you’re getting a bigger investment and putting your equity to work for you by having your tenants pay rent, and still not paying any capital gains tax.</b> You’re delaying paying any meaningful taxes until further down the road when you’re not in your strongest income years.</span></span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: normal;">&nbsp;</span><br /></span><br /><div class="quote-box"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><span class="quote quote-left">“</span></span><br /><div class="quote-text"><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">If you’re an investor, you need to think about using a tax deferred exchange.   </span></div><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><span class="quote quote-right">”</span> </span></div><span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /><span style="font-size: normal;">The question, then, isn’t whether investing in real estate is a good idea, but how to do it in a savvy manner. I have no problem paying taxes; I just don’t plan to be paying more than I need to.<br /><br />If any of this interests you, reach out to me by giving me a call or sending me an email.
