What is your home worth in today’s market? Today I am explaining our current market values.<br>&nbsp;<br>The spring of 2018 saw another momentous kick. From January to April, the average sale price in Marysville rose $37,000. In Lynnwood, the average sale price went up $59,000, while prices in sleepy Snohomish went up $57,000. **Everett saw the biggest increase in the area at $60,000.**<br>&nbsp;<br>So, what is going to happen now for this summer? If the market follows last summer’s trend, we will see prices even out a bit before dropping slightly in the fall. Then we increased at the end of the year into this year.

While I don’t currently have my crystal ball, I do know that **you have to get into the market in order to benefit from the market.** Those who owned a home in January and still own that same home today have at least 10% more value today than they did in January.<br>&nbsp;<br>So, is now the time for you to sell, take that equity out, and do something else? Or, is now the time for you to buy, make that equity work for you, and make your home’s value work for you? If either of these is the case, let me know. I would be glad to be a part of that resource for you.<br>&nbsp;<br>If you want to speak to me about buying or selling, please feel free to contact me. I look forward to speaking with you soon.
