Today I wanted to talk about land on the Tulalip Reservation, which can either be leased land from the Fryeburgs or it can be deeded.

**When the land is with the tribe, the land is owned by the tribe and you would pay them a monthly lease** fee that's based on the value of the land and reassessed every three years.

**When you lease from the Fryeburg family—who are part of the Tulalip Tribe and own the land—you pay an annual lease fee to them.** It's not actually overseen by the tribe, but by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The Fryeburg family leased land is reassessed every five years.

When you buy a property that is leased land, you're buying the improvements on the land, as well as the rights to the land. Much like deeded land, no one else can claim rights to it.

If you have any questions about tribal land or leased/deeded property, don't hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I'd be more than happy to help!
