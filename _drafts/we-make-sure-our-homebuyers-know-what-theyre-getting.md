The more things change elsewhere, the more they stay the same here in the Northwest. I was heading down through the East Snohomish Valley recently and saw some beautiful homes. **I also took in the beautiful, unmistakable aroma of cow manure.**

That’s just the way it is in the country. This is where we live, and it’s all a great big beautiful mix of sights, sounds, and scents. We have the outdoors, we have the golf courses, and we have the manure. This is where we love to be.

**When you’re looking for the home that really works for you, we want to make sure you know all about what’s around it.** That’s why we have disclosures and why we have experience.&nbsp;

If you have any questions for us about how we can get you into the right home in the right place for your family, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
