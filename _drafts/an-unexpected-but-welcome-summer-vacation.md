My family was supposed to head up to Victoria, B.C. over the 4th of July for some much needed relaxation time. However, not everyone could make it so we decided to scratch the plans for now and stay in the beautiful NW instead. It was fine because I was still able to spend time with the people I love.

**I also accomplished quite a bit during my time off.** I spent some time cleaning my garage and even fixed a shelf in there. I also planted a new cherry tree in the yard from Flower World and other assorted plants from Sunnyside Nursery.

I was even able to do some golfing up at Semiahmoo and had a lovely time up there. Between the time around home, in nurseries, and at the golf course, I was rejuvenated when it was time to go back to work. **I was able to spend my vacation at the places I love with the people I love and it was exactly what I needed.**

I would love to hear what youâ€™re doing for fun and relaxation this summer. If you want to let me know or if you have any questions about real estate, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you.
