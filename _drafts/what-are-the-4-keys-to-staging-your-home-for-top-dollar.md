You probably already know that when you sell a home, it’s not the same as when you live in a home. With that in mind, I have four tips you need to remember to stage your home to sell for top dollar in today’s market.
<br>
<br>My first tip is to make a good first impression because the **first impression is your only impression.** Buyers take about three to five seconds to make a first impression when they pull up to the house, so clean up the exterior, add some color to the porch, and make sure your trim is freshly painted. When buyers walk into your home, you have another three to five seconds to cement that first impression.
<br>
<br>This leads me to my next tip—**always be show ready.** In the mornings and evenings, take a look at each room and make sure everything is situated the way you want a buyer to see the house as they walk through it. One great tip I got from **[Flylady.net](Flylady.net)** is to go through your house every night and pick up the things you see in each room. When you get the call that someone is coming for a showing, have a list of “hot spots” to take a look at where you know things tend to accumulate quickly.

My third tip is to **take the “home” out of your house.** For example, you need to take personalized items like your family photos down, because that will cause buyers to see your family in the home instead of theirs. Also, if you have a specialized photo wall, it might make buyers uncomfortable due to the lack of perceived space when walking down that hallway.
<br>
<br>Next, put away about one-third of your stuff. If you have extra bookcases, tables, or trunks that are making any walkways smaller or more inconvenient than they need to be, you need to remove them. Normally I‘m not a huge fan of storage units, but they can come in handy in terms of storing these items in the short term. Also, make sure all your closets are half-empty. You want people to look inside of them and see that there’s plenty of room for clothes.
<br>
<br>My last and most important tip is to **hire an informed agent and price it right.** Pricing is critical when it comes to getting your home sold for top dollar in today’s market. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve seen people list their home for more than what it’s worth and end up taking less in the end. Hire an agent that’s doing business right now and understands what’s happening in your local market.
