You may know that buying and selling real estate is one of the top five most stressful things that someone can go through in their life, right along with death, divorce, and losing a job.

One of my clients was going through the stress of buying a new home, and in the beginning, it was a truly exciting time for them. They ran into an issue with the lender, who was creating problems with my client where there didn’t need to be any.

We were discussing together how to deal with this lender issue, and my client had done everything they could to get the process moving again. He told me something while we were working on it that really resonated with me: “I know I’m supposed to give this to God, but I just keep going and picking it back up again.”** I’m sure you can relate to that.**

Then I began to look at that situation a little differently. God has said over and over in the Bible, “Remember when.” **Over and over, God provided for his chosen people what they needed**, **at the exact moment that they needed it.** And I told my client, “I think the Lord is creating a ‘remember when moment’ for you.”

I had to remind my client that even though the situation seemed hopeless, and was getting worse, that if he continued to rely on God, then we would see some positive results. What ended up happening was that the lender referred us to someone who could help with the transaction. Eight days after we began working with a new lender, I was handing my client the keys to his new home.

**God has promised to provide for us.**He says in Deuteronomy 31:6, “Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or terrified because of them, for the Lord your God goes with you; he will never leave you nor forsake you.” That sentiment is echoed in Hebrew 13:5 and Philippians 4:19.

The words in the Bible are supposed to help us understand what’s happening in our lives at the current moment. The real-life situations that we deal with on a regular basis aren’t just supposed to be earthly conversations, we must allow God into them.

It was such a joy to be able to work with my client through this situation and share this heavenly experience with him. If there is anything that I can do to help you and your family, whether it be real estate or otherwise, please give me a call. I would be honored to help.
