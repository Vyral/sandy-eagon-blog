Life is like a box of chocolates, or maybe it’s like a bowl of cherries. I believe that making big life decisions is like the Now and Later candy; all of the life decisions that you make have something to do with now and something to do with later. So, how do you make those big decisions?

Anytime you face big life decisions, like buying a house, there are some people who can make a snap decision, jump right in, and everything turns out OK. Most of us take a slower tact. I want to encourage you to do three things when making those big decisions:

**1. Slow down to be wise.** Oftentimes, we can be distracted by the shiny and beautiful surfaces of things; we don’t always look to see what’s underneath. That can happen in all arenas of life. Let me encourage you to take a harder look and make sure that what you see is really going to be what you get. &nbsp;

**2. Pray about it.** Ask God, “What is it that you have for me and how does this fit in?” Don’t be afraid of the no; he might say no because he has something better in store for you later on. He might actually say yes, so you can be excited that you are on the same path and that you are walking along the purpose he has designed for you as your creator.

**3. Talk to others.** Talk to your spouse, parents, friends, or whoever you know who has a wise demeanor in this arena. Ask what they think about it. When I am out with single people who are buying a home, they don’t necessarily have another person to talk things over with or bounce ideas off of. In that case, I am honored to be on their “Board of Directors,” so to speak, and help them look at their options.

When you are considering a house, there are several things you need to keep in mind. For instance, does it make you smile when you walk in the door? Is the property structurally sound? The house might be really pretty but if the foundation wasn’t taken care of, then you have a problem. You should also consider whether or not you have the resources for upkeep.

So, when you make those big decisions, look at now and later. Go through the process to ensure that you make an exciting decision now that will still be a good decision down the road.

If you have any questions for me, please don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
