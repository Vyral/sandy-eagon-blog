Buying and selling real estate is a hot topic, both in the media and in casual conversation. A lot of people have a lot of experience buying and selling real estate, but the problem with that is sometimes that experience happened as far back as 10 to 20 years ago in different places than where they’re located now. In real estate, things happen differently in different times and different areas.

With that in mind, there are three main misunderstandings many of my smart sellers have been having lately:

**1. Who pays for what?**A couple of my sellers have assumed that because it’s a hot seller’s market, they can get the buyer to pay their closing costs, right? Wrong. The seller always pays their own fees. There’s a title fee, an escrow fee, an excise tax, and commissions, and the seller pays commissions for both the buyer’s agent and the seller’s agent. Remember, your prices reflect a market where the seller customarily pays those fees, so you’re actually getting the money for it, just not until the very end.

**2. What is personal property?**I had a seller recently insist that the buyer pay him separately for his propane tank in addition to the purchase price of the house. It took a while for him to understand that in this part of the country, the propane tank goes with the house because it’s connected to it and that’s how it gets its fuel. A lawnmower, on the other hand, is something you could sell to your buyer separately from the house’s purchase price.

**3. What stays and what goes?**My rule of thumb is if it’s wired in, it stays and if it’s screwed in, it usually stays. One of the most common misunderstandings in this regard is curtains and blinds, which always stay with the house. Obviously, these items are of a personal taste, so if they’re something you want to take with you, by all means, take them down ahead of time. Don’t let someone else fall in love with your curtains—that’s messed up more than one transaction.

Some of these things are common sense, and some pertain to a different way of viewing a real estate transaction. It doesn’t mean you’re stupid; it just means you’ve looked at something differently than the way it’s done here.

This is why it’s so important to **talk to a Realtor you can trust to lead you down the right path of making smart decisions** and you don’t end up shooting yourself in the foot.
