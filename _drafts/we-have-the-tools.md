Today I’d like to remind you of a service I provide my friends, clients, and neighbors: Sandy’s Tool Shed. Summer is wrapping up, and for many, that means taking care of some fall cleaning tasks. Our team would like to help by loaning you pressure washers, extension ladders, and other home maintenance tools that you use too rarely to buy yourself. Also, if you don’t know how to use these tools or would prefer someone else handle the jobs, we would be happy to refer you to one of our preferred contractors. We want to help you turn your house into a great place to come home to. To see my full message, watch this short video.
