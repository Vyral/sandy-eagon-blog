Today, I’ve got one easy way you can pay your mortgage off sooner and ultimately for less money.

If you’re an American today, you’ve likely got a housing payment. This is true whether you’re renting or you own a home. If you are renting, you’re probably trying to get to the point where you’re owning, instead.

The tip I have today can help regardless of your situation. It really can help you get where you’re trying to go, whether that is a paid-off mortgage or homeownership in general. Before I tell you what this tip is, understand that it’s a lot easier than it sounds.

**What I recommend actually has to do with paying slightly more than you currently are**. It doesn’t sound preferable at first, but let me explain.

At the beginning of this year, I decided I wanted to be at a certain point in my mortgage by the end of the year. I then looked at how much I was paying in principal and interest each month, as well as where I wanted to be with my mortgage at the end of the year.

After that, **I found the difference between these two figures and divided that number into 12 payments to add on top of my mortgage.** If you are looking for wealth, use this tip.

How much of a difference did this actually make? Well, using a loan term calculator that you can find here, I did some math. It turns out that I’m shaving off 14 years from my mortgage by doing this. **Additionally, I’m saving about $90,000 &nbsp;in interest that I won’t have to pay over the term of my mortgage.**

Many of us are guilty of simply seeing a number on our statement and just paying that particular amount. But, this doesn’t have to be your strategy. Just imagine all that you could be saving by using this simple tip. You can implement this incrementally, as well.

But remember, take care of any other debt you have first. If you need to take care of other areas of your finances before you can implement this strategy, visit [www.DaveRamsey.com](https://www.daveramsey.com/). Even if you pay just $50 extra per month on your mortgage, you would still be shaving time and money off your mortgage.

**These tips can help even if you aren’t currently paying a mortgage.** Let’s say you’re strapped with car payments right now. Making these additional payments can also make a big difference here. This applies to many other things, as well.

Be a great steward of your resources. What you have is what you’re supposed to take care of.
