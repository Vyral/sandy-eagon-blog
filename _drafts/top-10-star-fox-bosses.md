Even though we live in a very technical world with lots of paperwork and privacy regarding our financial documents, not everyone has the tools to make sure that privacy is protected. That is why Keller Williams Realty has designated June 1 as Shred Day for our clients and friends. Be sure to mark your calendars\! We’ll have a huge paper-shredding truck at our office so that you can come with your sensitive documents and be sure that they are destroyed properly, allowing you to keep your information safe. To learn more about our Shred Day event, watch my latest video. If you have any questions about Shred Day or about real estate in general, feel free to reach out to me. Regardless of whether you’re buying or selling a house, we are here for you.
