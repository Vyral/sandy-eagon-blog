If you’re a homeowner who is looking to downsize, what’s the next place that works best for you?

If you or someone you know is looking to downsize from a big home you’ve had for years in order to lower your expenses and the space you have to manage, we know that this transition can seem daunting, but we’re here to help.

Yesterday, I was walking through my neighborhood and met one of my neighbors who I found out was in a dire financial situation because she told me she was in pre-foreclosure. As it turns out, one of her in-laws who shared a joint account with her and planned on assisting her with her mortgage payments actually stole money from that account and lied about it.

Now this neighbor is a number of months late on her mortgage payment. She’s been consulting with an agent on how to rectify this situation and it sounds like she’s been getting assistance from her bank, but I’m not sure she’s getting the results she’s looking for. Needless to say, I have many concerns for this person. She has a significant amount of equity, so she can sell her home and put that equity into her next place, but what’s the next place that works best for her?

If you’re asking yourself this same question, **we have the resources and know many experts who specialize in assisting with the downsizing process.** They can clear out any clutter and help you sift through the loads of paperwork that you don’t need to hang on to anymore. We also know people who can help you find your next place and help you determine if you’re capable of maintaining your own apartment or you would like some assisted living.

These are the additional questions you need to ask yourself, and **we can help you with that at no charge**. Although I have a senior real estate specialist designation, that doesn’t really mean anything other than I have a heart for seniors and I’m ready to use my expertise for their benefit.

If you or someone you know is ready to downsize but you don’t know where to turn to next, don’t hesitate to reach out to me so we can sit down and have free, no-risk, no-obligation consultation. I’d be happy to help you.
