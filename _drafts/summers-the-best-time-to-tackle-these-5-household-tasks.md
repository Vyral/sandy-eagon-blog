Summer can be a great time for some to-do list items around the house that are a little more weather-dependent. There are five things in particular that you should consider doing to your Puget Sound home this summer while the weather's fine:

**1. Paint:** Houses get thirsty! They need to be caulked and painted, which are the first barriers for water damage in your house.

**2. Taking care of your windows:** Popped seals are a common issue here, so now is the time to look into new vinyl windows. The perfect window is one that doesn't draw attention to the window itself, just what's on the other side.

**3. Fences:&nbsp;**It's a perfect time to take a look while it's sunny and (hopefully) not rainy. Keep it strong to keep the pets in and add beauty to your property. There are plenty of options that will fit almost any budget whether thatâ€™s chain link, cedar, or something in between.

**4. The driveway:** This could mean just cleaning it if it doesn't have big cracks that will trip people or big chunks of grass growing up through it. I'll even lend you my power washer if you need it! It might also be time to pour new concrete; there are some great options from aggregate to stamping designs that you can use to make your driveway beautiful and inviting.

**5. Yard space:&nbsp;**Where do you gather with your family and friends? Updating your yard can be as easy as putting in a fire pit, or you could go the outdoor kitchen route with a big patio with a grill, fireplace, and a cover or pergola for year-round entertaining. These are important in our part of the country where clear skies are a little less dependable. You could also add in some game spots like horseshoes or a volleyball net. Make your yard a place that you can enjoy as an extension of your home.
