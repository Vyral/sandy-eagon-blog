Look at Shirley's really clean sidewalk! Shirley borrowed Sandy and Company's pressure washer that we lend to clients and community members, and her son used it over Memorial Day weekend. Just another way we are your home resources, Making Lives Better!!

Happiness is organized, clean shelf and storage! I bought IKEA shelves and Lowe's molly bolts, and used Sandy's Tool Shed's drill and bit driver to make it happen. Remember- We are here to help you with your home, when you're buying and selling and in between for sale prep and maintenance. We also have a pressure washer, extension ladder, circular saw, sawhorses and more! Ask us before you rent or buy that next tool! 425-422-7372

In my tool shed at home, I made some additions and improvements. I’d like to share them with you today.

Recently, I added a pegboard space to organize tools in my shed. I picked it out at a local hardware store. With saws, we were able to cut it to fit the size of our wall.

If you’re looking for any home tools, please talk to me! I can help you out. I’d love to share my resources with you. Don’t rent it out. I have plenty of tools that I’m willing to loan out to the community. Don't be afraid to ask!

As always, please don't hesitate to reach out to me with any and all of your real estate questions. Please reach out by phone or email!

As you may know, we like to share our tools with our clients. We call it Sandy's Tool Shed! Any of our clients are able to use them, and we have two more tools available in our shed.

First is a pressure washer, which can be really useful for improving your curb appeal and maintaining a beautiful home. Wash off the side of your home, your driveway, your patio, or any other outdoor space. My husband used it on our patio which now looks brand new! All you have to do is contact me and set up a time to come pick it up.

The second addition to our tool shed is a power paint sprayer. This tool takes a little bit of training, so when you borrow it, please have a good idea of how to operate it, or plan a little extra time to learn before you jump in.

A power paint sprayer can be a little tricky. And we want you to have a great experience when using our tools. After all, we like you to associate our help with great results, not with frustration! So if you feel like a power paint sprayer is a little more than you can handle, I will recommend a great painter who can do a beautiful job for you. New paint is proven to add a lot of value to a home and is important to maintain your home's condition.

So now Sandy's Tool Shed includes 2 extension ladders, a carpet cleaner, plumbing snake, ratchet straps for securing loads, the pressure washer and power paint sprayer, and various yard tools. As always, please feel free to contact us if you want to borrow these tools, and let us know what else you recommend we add!

Always refer to us as your #1 resource for real estate in Puget Sound!

Do you have a project that you're waiting to complete because you don't have the right tools? Depending on what you need, tools can be extremely expensive.

Luckily, I have collected some tools from my sellers, and you're able to rent them from me as long as you sign a release. We have ladders, carpet cleaners, and more.

I recently got a hold of an extension ladder that fits in your car and stands up to twelve feet tall. You can paint vaulted ceilings or underneath your eaves. I'm happy to let you to use these items; all you have to do is contact me!

Please let me know which tools you're looking for- I'm gathering the equipment that people need most.

As always, please contact me if you're looking to buy or sell in Puget Sound.
