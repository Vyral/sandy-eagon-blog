  - quote: '“She was very easy to work with, very professional and it ended in purchasing our home. She regularly went above and beyond, I just got a sense that she was very in tune with her job and she was always giving us helpful advice.”'

  - quote: '“When I wanted to put my house up for sale, I knew that Sandy was familiar with the neighborhood. She listed it and within four days it was sold. I was very happy with the quick work that she did for me. It was good. She always works good, she always does above what she needs to do. Everything that Sandy does it just seems like it is top, top notch. I would recommend her to anybody.”'

  - quote: '“Well the results were fantastic. She guided me through the whole process, she was there when I got crazy and helped me. I can’t say enough about her. I’m very pleased with everything she did for me and she was right there all the time doing what had to be done and keeping me informed. I’m very satisfied with her. You know buying a house is so confusing, but she was right there with all the answers and guiding me through it, and just the whole thing. She’s always there. And that’s what I like about her, and she tells you up front what it is, what’s going on, how it’s going to happen. I’ve bought houses before and it’s never been this easy. I mean I’m not saying it was perfectly easy because there’s always things that the lenders do, but she was always right there for me.“'

  - quote: '“I thought she went beyond my expectation as far as working on our behalf. I was very pleased with the way she was able to act as a go-between between ourselves and the builder. She was effective and she put forth more effort than most people would usually do, so I was very pleased. And she was easy to work with, with us. I was really glad to have her as my Realtor. The builder made a commitment to us that he later reneged on and she took it upon herself to write a request explaining our particular difficult situation that he would reconsider. And they did try to reconsider and do what they could to help us out. I don’t think that would have happened if she hadn’t stuck her neck out for us.“'

  - quote: 'I’ve worked with Sandy before so I had utter confidence in what she suggested as a listing price. When she listed it I signed the papers and two seconds later the sign went up and about an hour and a half later I can’t even begin to tell you how many agents walked in with their clients. That was on a Thursday and we had all the offers that we needed by Saturday. What more can I say. I was hysterical because I didn’t expect it to happen that fast. She was very calming to me because I really was [hysterical]. I thought I’d have a couple weeks or something, I didn’t expect to have an offer in two days. She not only calmed me, she had an open house.  You know I was saying let’s forget the open house and she said no, this can make the difference between the listing price or less. So I said okay, fine. In order to prep the house she had equipment that I could borrow that was so very necessary such as a power washer, a rug cleaner. This woman is on the ball. I will tell you at the close of sale things went a little screwy and she knocked herself to make things right for me. I can’t praise her enough.'

  - quote: 'She was very pleasant and she did a fantastic job for us, we were very, very pleased with her. I’ve lived in the same house for like 27 years so I haven’t dealt with very many Realtors, but I know quite a few and she was just very pleasant, we enjoyed working with her. She did a good job for us.'

  - quote: '“It was great, everybody in their office, and Sandy included, handled my stress. I was crying sometimes I had to pay a bill, there was a lien on my home that I knew nothing about and they were so genuinely nice. They didn’t judge, it was just, it was great. If I had to ever do anything again she’d be my lady I’d call. I did a lot of the selling of the home, the short sale, without my husband, I mean because he was so busy, but they handled my stress. Every question, she was right there. She was like, I’ll show it, get the house and get all the paperwork [ready] don’t worry.  That was above and beyond. A lot of people think oh they’re doing a short sale, no big thing. Or you know, oh look at them, they didn’t criticize or judge or do any of that and I felt comfortable with that. It made me feel good.”'

  - quote: '“We had been trying to sell our house with a different agent. [Then] we got Sandy. Very much of a go getter and which was appreciated because my husband and I didn’t have a whole lot of time to set up things like open houses and what not. I mean she did a lot of work setting up open houses and marketing it. [She] had a great photographer come in. If something needed to be checked at the house, my husband and I were both out of the house for a time, and sometimes we’d need a quick turnaround on looking at something and we wouldn’t be able to make it up and so she’d actually go over and handle it. Like I think there were a couple times she took the garbage can down from the road. Which I wasn’t even expecting her to do that. But that was fantastic.&nbsp; We had a question of the square footage and she actually went over and measured the whole house and you know did a quick estimate there just to do a quick sanity check. So that was really good.”'

  - quote: '“She was really responsive and prompt and pleasant and friendly and helpful. She totally helped my husband stage the house because I was out of town before the photographer came and I felt bad. It was definitely above and beyond because well, it should have been something that we would have done. I was happy about that because I couldn’t help.“'

  - quote: '“Oh Sandy was great, we really appreciated her help, she was awesome.&nbsp; We were going to see some houses that she had listed that she found for us to look at and on the way my wife saw an open house. We stopped, we liked that place and it wasn’t listed with Sandy, we told her about it and she said would you like to make an offer, we made an offer and she coordinated the whole thing with the other realtor and we ended up getting the house and it was fantastic for us throughout the whole process. She was available night and day no matter what time or always willing to listen to our questions, was very responsive, text, email, or by phone [we] could always get ahold of her or she would be calling us back or contacting us right away whenever we had any type of questions, concerns, or misunderstandings. [She] was very patient but also really good at communicating and helping us through the whole process and teaching us how the whole thing worked and she was great.”'

  - quote: 'Our experience with her was fantastic! We had an unorthodox situation where the bank wanted us to keep the house, and we were just done working with them. We worked with Sandy for over a year. Her entire team is phenomenal. They persisted no matter what. Sandy is amazing. She was right there with us the entire time!'

  - quote: "Oh the results were fantastic. We looked for a house for several years and Sandy was always there for us. She'd constantly send us updates on notes, she was right on top of everything as far as what we were looking for. We called on a Wednesday or a Thursday and said, \"We're coming down for the weekend, can you meet us?\" And she was there on Saturday and had houses lined up for us to look at and we bought one of those."

  - quote: 'We got a house we wanted, we got rid of a house we didn’t want. In spite of all the little things that were caused by other things outside of her control it went really well. The buyers of our house that we were [selling] were making it difficult and she was going out of her way to help us get everything taken care of. Getting it repaired, she actually supplied us with a moving truck and couple of strong guys to help us move since we got behind the 8-ball between the buyers of our old house and getting into our new house. I mean considering all the stuff that happened it went really well. I mean there was a lot of things that got in the way, a lot of circumstantial stuff that doesn’t normally happen in the process of buying and selling homes and she was working for us on the selling and the buying aspect. Considering all the stuff that tried to sidetrack us it all went really well and she kept going above and beyond to get us where we needed to be and get into the new house.'
