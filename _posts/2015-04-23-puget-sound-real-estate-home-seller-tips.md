Today I'll be giving you advice on certain things you should not be doing to your home before you go to sell it, and then I'll also give some suggestions on other things that you can do instead.

One thing that I've been getting questions about lately is whether or not sellers should be adding granite counter tops. My answer is always NO because multiple surveys have revealed that you don't get your investment back when you sell your home. Instead, you can just clean your kitchen and countertops extremely thoroughly. Although it may not have the same appeal as granite, your kitchen will be spotless and will signal to the buyer that your home is in good shape.

Another thing you need to do is repaint the interior of your home. Pets and kids can really wreak havoc on the walls, and the same goes for carpeting. If your carpet is more than one to two years old, then I would highly suggest getting new carpet and repainting your home in light earth tones. Repainting and putting in new carpet are pretty solid ways to add value to your home when you go to sell later on.

One last thing that you might consider if you have hardwood floors is to refinish them. This can add a nice touch, and buyers will be appreciative that you went the extra step and had this done to your home.

If you don't have the time to do these things for yourself, I know excellent contractors that can come in and get this job done quickly and efficiently.

As always, if you need assistance when you're buying or selling in Marysville, please don't hesitate to contact me.
