Waiting on the Lord is an evolving experience. When I have an obstacle or issue, I start to worry. When things don't happen right, that's where my worry kicks in.

I have noticed that my approach is different when observing others. I recently had a coworker who got very worried, upset, and anxious, and I was thinking to myself, "Why are they so upset? Don't they know it's just work, and it will be over at 5pm?" Then it hit me. It doesn't really matter why it bothers him, it just does.

When I sat back and reflected on this, it allowed me to realize that, looking in, if I could detach myself emotionally from the situation, I can take away the emotional response and look at things more objectively. Then I can rely on my faith and trust in the Lord that things will be alright.

God provides for me, but sometimes I forget this. This has happened to all of us; we forget to remember him. It's not remembering in the mental sense, it's kind of a sensory recall where you put yourself in a situation where the Lord has previously delivered you. For me, I try to remember that God brought me out of the wilderness of 2007 and 2008, and I'm here and better off for it.

I have found that I have more peace and understanding that all will be well, both in my heart and my head, when I trust in the Lord. I do this by having a constant relationship with Him, and making sure He knows all my fears, struggles, and aspirations, so He can help me make them a reality.

If you have any questions for me, or would like to discuss how you deal with impatience or anxiety, give me a call or send me an email. I would love to chat, and am always here to be there for you.
