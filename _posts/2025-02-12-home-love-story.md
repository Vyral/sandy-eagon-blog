{% include excerpt.html %}

In mid-October my friend reached out saying that someday she and her partner wanted to have a home together. They’re both mature, retired, and living separately in full size houses. Now they wanted to be together, but neither of their houses were quite right. Plus, they’d love a view of water.

We met and talked about their hopes. She shared a couple houses she’d been looking at. They lived in Everett and Lynnwood, but they were willing to move over to the peninsula or south of Olympia to find something affordable with a view of the water.

I showed them two houses much closer: one in Tulalip and the other in Everett that they hadn’t even considered, being so close to where they were now, and they loved them both. And loved the style of the Everett house with a lovely view of the Sound just a little bit more.

But what to do next? **Most of their money was wrapped up in their homes, and they knew that a contingent offer would be rough when they had two houses to sell.**

I connected them with my lender Howard with Evergreen Mortgage. They have a program that fit my friends perfectly. Requires a small down payment, and Evergreen Mortgage buys the first house. Then we have 30 days to get the next house (or houses, in this case) on the market for sale.

That’s what we did. We closed their together-purchase at the end of November. Brought my contractor into both their homes for some repairs and slight updating. Had his house under contract by Christmas and her house under contract by the New Year. And everything was closed (and back down to one house payment!) before February.

**Now my friends can have a Valentine’s snuggle with their Puget Sound view and giggle about how we made their dreams come true: not just Someday, but Now.**

Who do you know who needs a local expert with connections to the right people to make and execute the plan for getting into a home that feels like love right now? Call, message, or email us with the info just below, and **let us get to work writing your Home Love Story.**

We can’t wait!
