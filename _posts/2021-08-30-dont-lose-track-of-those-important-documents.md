I have had two completely separate clients over the last two days searching desperately for their letter that comes out every year and says how much social security they’re collecting. One of them is to qualify for a loan, and the other one is to qualify for tenancy in a mobile home park. Both of those people really needed it in a timely manner.&nbsp;

This is one of those things that you think, “You know what, yeah, yeah yeah. I’m going to get the bank statement every month, I’m going to see that it’s in there,” but you know what? For bookkeeping purposes and honestly, I don’t know what else you may need it for, but I’ll bet you it might come up, and **if you need it, you’re going to wish you had it.**

So that letter that comes at the end of the year that says what you're getting the year following or the one that comes the first off as soon as you start getting your social security or your disability, save it. Put it in a file folder with your important documents so you know that you'll be able to find it when you need it. That place that says, ”Hmm, I put it somewhere so that I would remember.” Make sure you actually remember where it is.

This is just a quick message today because anytime I start seeing a pattern and think, “You know what? I think more people need to know about this,” **we end up helping a lot of people through the process of homeownership**, whether it’s in the actual purchase, or in helping them get their things together to finance, or obviously other options as well. This is one of the things you’re going to need.
