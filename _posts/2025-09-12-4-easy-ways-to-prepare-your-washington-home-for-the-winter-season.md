Fall is officially here! Pumpkin spice is back, pampas grass is showing its beautiful foliage that will last through winter, and school buses are on the road. Like it or not, summer is gone, and it’s time to get your home ready for the colder months.

Here are four things you should check off your list before winter:

**1\. Protect your outdoor faucets.** It may not be freezing yet here in the Northwest, but it will be soon. If you’re still watering your garden, make sure to put those hoses away and cover your faucets before the first freeze. Broken pipes are expensive, and one of the best ways to protect your investment is by taking care of your plumbing as you go along. Ensure that your faucets and pipes are in great condition to last through the winter.

**2\. Clean your gutters and roof.** Clogged gutters are one of the worst things for your roof. All the debris in the gutters can affect the roof, trapping moisture and causing damage over time. Before you know it, all that wood in your roof will be soggy, leading to a mess later on. So, take care of your roof by cleaning it a couple of times a year and ensuring your gutters allow water to drain away from your home.

**3\. Service your furnace and AC.** Don’t wait until it’s too cold to have your heating system checked. Schedule a service now while it’s mild so your HVAC company can take care of both your furnace and AC in one visit. A little maintenance goes a long way in avoiding costly surprises.

**4\. Inspect your fireplace and chimney.** If you love cozy fires in the winter, make sure your chimney is clear and safe. Birds and other critters may have nested there over the summer. A quick inspection ensures your flue is clean so you only get warmth, not smoke or unwanted surprises, when you light that first fire.

Taking care of these fall maintenance tasks helps prevent bigger problems later and keeps your home in great shape.

**What’s happening in the market?** If you’re looking to buy or sell a house soon, we are at an incredible point in the market. With the Federal Reserve meeting in the coming week, around the time you might be watching this, our lenders are already lowering their interest rates.

This will create opportunities for the next set of buyers to find homes that truly fit their needs. We have several clients ready for this change, eager to find something that suits their budget.
