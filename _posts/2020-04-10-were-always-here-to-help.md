Today we’re talking about what’s happening in the market right now. With all the uproar about the coronavirus, for good or for bad, there are ways that we are affected that you may not even be thinking about.

**A lot of people are asking me what’s happening in the market.** My buyers are asking whether they should wait, and my sellers are also asking whether they should wait. As usual, it all depends on what’s happening in your life. Real estate is a life-driven business. We’re still having people who are being relocated for work. We’re still having parents who need to go into assisted living or somewhere that better fits their needs. In nine months from now, we’ll have a few more babies joining this world as well.

So, what do you need for real estate? And we’re here to provide that. And just like usual, if there’s anything else that I can help you with, house-wise or otherwise, we’re here for you. If you need something, I will get it for you or I will get it to you. One or the other. If there’s something at all that I can do to help, please let me know.

If you are looking to sell or buy a house, please click the link or give me a call—direct message me. Let’s be in touch. Let’s have a conversation and see how I can help you right now, whether it’s to sell your house right now or whether it’s to get ready for upcoming.

Have an amazing day. **Stay healthy, stay safe, and let’s all get through this together.** Be blessed.
