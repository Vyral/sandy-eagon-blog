This past Christmas, the story of Christ that we love to tell, the time spent with our family, and talking about what’s most important for this year fueled recognition of one principle: **It’s important to keep it simple and stay true to your top priority in 2019.**

When it comes to real estate, whether my clients plan to buy or sell this year, I’ll assist them in this way by asking them what’s most important about the investment they’re about to make. Is it the space? Is it the security? Is it going to shorten commutes or provide for other family members? **The overarching question will be: What will this move do for your life?**

**As we move into a shifting market, we are committed to serving you.** We’ll strive to get at least one more family into the home of their dreams every month throughout the coming year. Because we love working with you and all our clients, we know we’ll love working with your friends and family as well.

If there’s someone you know that has plans to buy or sell real estate this year, please give us a call. We’d love to talk about getting them what’s most important out of a home purchase in 2019—that could mean the space, security, or whatever top priority that answers what it will do for their life.

For help with any and all of your real estate needs, again, give us a call. We’re here to help and I’m excited to start 2019 off right!
