Hey there, Sandy with Sandy and Company. And guess what? I sold my house.

So in today's hot market, some of our sellers panic because they're like, my gosh, what am I going to do next? And you know what? I have sold my house, and I don't know where I'm going next. But you know what? I do have options. And part of when we are making a plan to sell your house is we're going to talk about what do you need to do next?

What does that need to look like? And we're going to be putting protections in your experience so that you're not homeless. I keep saying I have never left a seller homeless, and I don't expect myself to be the first. And I've been talking with another couple of people that are selling, and I say, you know what? You're not going to be the second because we're not even going to have a first. It has never happened.

So, what is happening to me right now? Well, as you can see, the house is not quite as picked up as it was when we were showing. And I'm getting ready to pack and move, and I've got my tape and my dishes, and we are getting ready to go, but we don't know where we're going yet.

I have several options. We've been looking at houses, but you know what? I have time. I've got a little bit of a longer closing and I've got three weeks of possession afterwards that the buyer is going to wait after closing before they are going to move in. So these are just some of the things that we do to make sure that we protect our people.

It's all about the whole picture. It's all about making sure that you are safe and that you have the priorities in place that are most important to you. What is most important? Is it the money? Is it the timing? Is it the security? Is it how much work you have to do to get there? That's what we ask you upfront is what's most important to you? And then we guard it like a dog.

So, if you are looking for someone who is ready to take your priority and get you into the home that you need, then talk to us. Reach out. Message. We are ready to go to work for you today. And at the same time, I'm looking for a house for me today. And I will keep you posted on what's next. You can guarantee that. Have a super blessed day. Stay safe. Stay healthy. Our motto is making lives better. How can we help you with yours?
