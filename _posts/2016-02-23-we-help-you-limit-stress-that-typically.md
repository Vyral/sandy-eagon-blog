About a year and a half ago, a couple reached out to me online. They were looking for a home that fit them and their three large dogs and property with breathing room between them and neighbors. We looked for about a year, but nothing worked perfectly. Then their landlord told them that he was selling the rental they lived in. Urgency kicked in- they needed a home that they could count on rather than try to find another landlord who would allow their dogs.

We found them a great house next to forestry land- country living and trails through the the forestry acres to walk the dogs. But the night we all came to agreement, a windstorm knocked three trees into the house.

I communicated with the listing agent regularly and then the contractor to see how work was going. Unfortunately, after two months, we realized we were no closer to work starting on the home and needed to keep looking.

Keeping this contract in place as a back-up, we chose a rambler that was perfect for their needs. It was more money, and it had a long honey-do list that came with it, but the home and property worked better for my clients than the "tree-house." We helped them get bids on a couple of the projects to make sure they weren't biting off more than they could chew. And our lender handled their financing which was a little tricky. After we'd cleared all the obstacles on this perfect home, we let the first house go.

Now our friends are securely in their own home with elbow room that they'll treasure for many years to come.

We work hard to find security for our buyers so that they have a plan B should their initial plan fall through. The beauty is that sometimes Plan B turns out even better than Plan A. It’s worked for our other clients, and we’d love to make it work for you!

If you have any real estate questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We would love to hear from you!

*"Sandy is one of the most positive, upbeat, motivated, caring and just plain nice people I have ever worked with.  I believe she is actually interested in helping improve the lives of each and every client that is lucky enough to have come in contact with her.*

*We had a unique situation with pretty specific needs in finding the right house.   We searched and searched with Sandy and her team, looking at house after house.  We looked at so many I was worried about Sandy giving up on us.  She never did at all.  We finally found "the house" and Sandy negotiated a great deal for us.  The very night we signed the agreement the winds came up and blew not one but three trees down on the house destroying much of the upper level.  Sandy was out there with us every step again and when it became apparent the repair project would not meet our time frame needs, it was off to look at more houses.  I just knew now she had to be sick of us and would send us on our way to find another agent, but not a chance.  With the same care and energy from day one she set out to find us a great home.  After many more appointments and miles and miles of travel for Sandy and her team, we found an even better home in a beautiful location with plenty of room and trees to enjoy for years to come.  I am amazed that Sandy always had the same big smile and enthusiasm at each property we viewed and I believe that that through all this journey to find our home we were so very lucky to have come across Sandy Eagon."*  - John.
