During the wet windy winter months, I like to hunker down in my home and enjoy some of my favorite activities.&nbsp;

**Whether it’s reading a good book, like John Eldredge’s “Moving Mountains,” journaling, or knitting, I have been really enjoying making the most of my downtime.**

Another thing I’m rarely without when I am home is a cup of tea. You’ve got to check out Everything Tea down on First Street. While you’re there you’ll find old favorites, new flavors, and everything in between.&nbsp;

If you’re feeling adventurous enough to brave the winter weather, all it takes is a good cap. We’ve got amazing gear here available in our local area. There is so much to do in the Pacific Northwest, even during these cool, wet days.&nbsp;

As always, feel free to give me a call or send me an email if you have any questions about real estate or anything I’ve mentioned here today. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
