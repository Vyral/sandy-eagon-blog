How do you balance life while thinking about preparing for your next home? I was just talking with a great client and friend. We were reconnecting, and as she shared what was happening in her life, she was also managing the kids, reminding them not to color on the windows. It made me laugh, and I realized I needed to capture this inspiration right away.

**What’s happening right now in real estate?** We’re hearing that interest rates are expected to drop next month. This is an opportunity for anyone looking to buy or refinance.

*I recommend that you start preparing your applications and get that approval ready.* Because when the rates drop, I don’t want you to be caught off guard. To help you get started, try answering these questions:

* What are you doing right now to improve your financial situation and prepare for your next home?
* If you’re already in a home but considering refinancing, what steps can you take now to ensure you have a lovely household in a home that fits your budget?

**What can you do right now?** First, remember to keep the kids from coloring on the windows! Tomorrow, they’ll be starting kindergarten, and before you know it, they’ll be graduating. You’re doing an amazing job as a parent.
