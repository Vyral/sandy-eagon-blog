Hi, this is Sandy with Sandy and Company, and today we are talking about when our clients feel stuck in their homes.&nbsp;

This homeowner contacted me several years ago because he and his wife were feeling like they needed to go to the one-level house. Both getting older, had some health issues, and it was just becoming more and more difficult for them to stay in this house.

So I came over and **I talked with them about what that looked like, what the value was, what they could do next, and really what worked out better for them was just changing the payment.** And they decided that the function of the house works just fine. In that case, they went ahead and to talk with a lender and I recommended them to a great lender who was familiar with a reverse mortgage. Is that always the right tool? No. But in this case, it worked really well and it kept him in this house for, honestly, the rest of his days.

I got a call a couple of months ago and this homeowner had just passed away. So his son was calling me, who actually was the original client and the way we had met in the first place, and said, Dad just passed away, and he needed to do something for mom to make sure that she was taken care of, but it was not going to be in this house.

She needed more help than that, and so she moved in with him for a little while and we got the house sold. Some people think that with a reverse mortgage, that the bank owns the house. That is not true. We sold this house just like we do any other, and she is getting a hefty chunk of change that will keep her in wherever she needs to be next, very comfortably.

Are you feeling like maybe your house doesn't fit you anymore, or maybe your payment doesn't fit you anymore? And you need to look at the options and find out what really works best for you. That's where we come in and we talk about, this is what you can do. Yes, you can sell your house and this is what it looks like to do something else next.

<br>Or maybe you're going to stay here and you just need to change how it's financed. Let me know. **We are a great resource so that we can help you figure out what works for you.** If it is staying in your house and changing your payment, great. And if it is moving out, getting fewer stairs and less yard to mow, great. Let's talk. Let's be your resource.&nbsp;

Our motto is making life better. How can we help with yours? Have a super blessed day. I'm excited to talk with you about your real estate needs. Be blessed.
