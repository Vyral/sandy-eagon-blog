A few months ago, one of our lenders called and told us about a Lake Stevens couple who were moving out of state and needed to sell their house in Lake Stevens before they could buy—that was in South Dakota. They started working on their house to get it ready, took a trip over to South Dakota, and found a new construction home that was willing to wait for them to sell, came back, and listed their house.&nbsp;

You may think that's only in South Dakota, but last month, one of our other lenders called us about a Marysville couple, a mother and daughter, who were looking for that mother and daughter mother-in-law type situation where they could live together but still have their own space. They already had a house in mind; **we got their contingent offer accepted, and then we listed their house to sell.**

This is a changing market that gives more opportunities. Our South Dakota couple has already sold here and is watching their South Dakota home be built—pretty exciting about that. And with our Marysville seller finding a buyer within a week, they are feeling comfortable on both sides. Our market is shifting and that gives you greater opportunity.

**Homeowners are not feeling stuck in their houses because they can't find something else.** This gives them the safety of knowing that they're not going to be homeless before they can find the right home for them. How does that impact you and your family? If you're looking for that right real estate agent who has experience working in changing markets, then we are here to help. Call me, message, email me and let's talk about you. Stay safe, stay healthy, and have a super blessed day.
