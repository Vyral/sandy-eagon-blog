Are you thinking about selling your house but not really sure what you should do to get the most bang for your buck? Today, we’ll take a little field trip to Lowe's to discuss what steps you can take.

There are three key things you can do to get the most of your money back when it comes to the price of your home when selling.

**1\. Paint.** Painting is the easiest way to make surfaces clean, give a space a fresh look, and eliminate bumps and bruises you've been living with, often without even noticing them. It makes the home feel clean and inviting.

When buyers walk in, they’ll think, "I don’t even have to paint before I move in."

And if you're worried that they might just change the color right away, who cares? This will still help you get the best price. They can always make their personal design choices later.

**2\. Fix your plumbing and lighting.** If something's broken, fix it. The two easiest ways to do that are to ensure that all of your lights work in your space and that all of your plumbing works without any leaks.

Those repairs tell the buyers that you have taken care of the issues as you've gone along, and you probably don't have hidden concerns that you just ignored and waited to address later.

Some of these light fixtures cost less than $100, and you can not only make something in good repair but also update it as well.

**3\. Flooring.** Do you need new carpet or laminate? Are your floors showing signs of wear and tear? This can be a major concern for buyers. When they walk into a house, they often don't know what the flooring will cost to replace.

And if you’re thinking, "Someone will just come in and replace it all when they move in," that’s okay. It will still add value to your home because the buyer won’t have to make repairs before they can move in and make the space their own.

So if you're thinking that today is the day to make a change and you need to clean things up in order to sell, these are three things: paint, carpet, and minor repairs for lighting and plumbing.

And if you just want to give your home a little refresh, so that you can feel like it's a nice, fresh space, those are some ways to make things feel better around you as well.
