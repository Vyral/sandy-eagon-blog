We are in the spring competition and guess what? We are winning. Whether we are working for our sellers or our buyers, we have actually won for both in the last couple of months and we are loving it. 

**Every time we enter this new competition, we are learning more and more about how to serve our clients and that’s what I love.** In the last couple months our buyers have competed every time: against one, two, and even eight other buyers.

And you know what? **We are learning how to win in this climate for our clients.** It’s <u>not</u> just all about price. There are a lot of different factors that actually make it work.

For our sellers, the last two times we’ve sat down with offers, it has been six and twelve offers. And– Wow, did you see those bald eagles going by fast? That was amazing. Wow. Bunny trail. 

You know, this is what I love about my job. It’s never the same thing every day and it’s never boring.

So– My last seller had six offers. The one before had 12 offers in two days. I love what I do. I love to help my clients. We strategize. **We make sure that we’re going to be on top in getting their needs met.**

Let me know what I can do to help you. If you’re looking to buy right now, go ahead and click on the box to search all area homes. If you are looking to sell, click on the box for your home’s value in **today’s** market.

Thanks so much\! I’m excited to talk to you about your real estate needs. Have an amazing day and go check out our Northwest and see a bald eagle or two. There’s another one right there\! It’s just so cool. Have a great day, I’m going to go look at this bald eagle.
