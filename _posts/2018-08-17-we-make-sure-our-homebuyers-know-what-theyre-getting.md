The more things change, the more they stay the same, even here in the Northwest. I was heading down through the Snohomish Valley a couple weeks ago and saw some new, beautiful homes. And then I took in the unmistakable aroma of cow manure.

**That’s just the way it is in the country.** This is where we live: it’s all a great big beautiful mix of sights, sounds, and scents. We have the outdoors, we have the golf courses, and we have the manure. And still this is where we love to be.

**When you’re looking for the home that really works for you, we make sure you know all about what’s around it.** That’s why we have disclosures and how we use our experience.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about how we can get you into the right home in the right place for your family, don’t hesitate! Give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
