We watch the trends all the time about what’s going on in today’s market. What’s happening in the last month, six months, a year. What we can project forward moving into the next few months and even to this next week. And as much as those trends have shown us that the market is strong, and it is strong,&nbsp;**there is still a little bit of a change in the air right now.**

Now it is fall. The air is cooling. We were used to 90 degrees, 100 degrees. It was really steaming hot and fast and furious. Now suddenly I’m seeing that things are shifting a little. We’ve had two buyers right now who have had their offers accepted even when they had to sell their current house first. It’s been a process. We’ve had to work through it,&nbsp;**but we have two buyers who are purchasing even though they have a house to sell**. That is one big indicator of how I can tell things are changing because in the market where everybody was going red hot, and houses were selling with so many buyers that don’t have a house to sell, that wouldn’t have even been considered.

**The second thing I’m seeing is that we have houses on the market for longer.**&nbsp;We had a house just last week that we listed, and for the first time in probably a couple of years, it has lasted longer than the Monday that we were reviewing the offer. We’re not worried. We know we’re in a good position. We’ve got a game plan, but it’s just telling me that things are shifting.

Like I said, when it was 90 degrees and then it turns into the 80s and 70s, sometimes it feels a little chilly. If I’m a seller, I might actually be concerned about this, but the exciting part is that there is not a concern, there’s just the game plan. You’re going to sell and buy in the same market. Whether it’s up or whether it’s down, you’re going to get the opportunity on one side and the tension on the other. So you’re going to be fine ultimately.

The opportunity that we see here is that we have a chance for sellers to go ahead and find the next house without having to take away all the safeties that make it an easier transition.&nbsp;

**So, here’s the question I have for you:**&nbsp;Are you looking to buy? Are you looking to sell? Do you need to change your home? Do we need to do it in a way that is a little easier on the stress factor? If that’s the case, this is the time for you. Let’s talk right now because who knows what’s going to happen in a month or six months. It might cook back up again and be 100 degrees-plus. But right now we have an opportunity for you to make that change and do it in such a way that you feel more comfortable.

Give me a call. Let’s talk today. If you’re looking for a Realtor who can gauge today’s temperature and today’s market and make today’s plan, then let’s talk today. Have a beautiful day, stay healthy, stay safe, be blessed, and I’ll talk with you soon.
