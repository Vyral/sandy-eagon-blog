As you may know, we like to share our tools with our clients. We call it Sandy's Tool Shed! Any of our clients are able to use them, and we have two more tools available in our shed.

First is a pressure washer, which can be really useful for improving your curb appeal and maintaining a beautiful home. Wash off the side of your home, your driveway, your patio, or any other outdoor space. My husband used it on our patio which now looks brand new! All you have to do is contact me and set up a time to come pick it up.

The second addition to our tool shed is a power paint sprayer. This tool takes a little bit of training, so when you borrow it, please have a good idea of how to operate it, or plan a little extra time to learn before you jump in.

A power paint sprayer can be a little tricky. And we want you to have a great experience when using our tools. After all, we like you to associate our help with great results, not with frustration! So if you feel like a power paint sprayer is a little more than you can handle, I will recommend a great painter who can do a beautiful job for you. New paint is proven to add a lot of value to a home and is important to maintain your home's condition.

So now Sandy's Tool Shed includes 2 extension ladders, a carpet cleaner, plumbing snake, ratchet straps for securing loads, the pressure washer and power paint sprayer, and various yard tools. As always, please feel free to contact us if you want to borrow these tools, and let us know what else you recommend we add!

Always refer to us as your #1 resource for real estate in Puget Sound!
