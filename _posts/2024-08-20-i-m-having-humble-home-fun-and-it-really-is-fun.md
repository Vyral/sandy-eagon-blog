Hey there. This is Sandy with Sandy and company. Today, we’re talking about how we can get our R&R just at home and in our own communities. It’s something, as we near the end of summer, that I don’t want you to miss out on.

As you may know by now, I did go ahead and sell my big place in Marysville, and I bought a little cottage home in Edmonds. And, you know, as I near the end of summer, I am just so grateful that I have things around my home that I really want to do. So I’m going to encourage you, if you’ve not thought much about what else you can do, that actually feel good before the summer is out. **I want you to think about what really makes you smile**—is it maybe having a project done? Yeah, that is kind of me. I do like getting things accomplished. Or is it just having some R&R with your family in the backyard, or is it reacquainting yourself with the neighborhood coffee shop?

There is so much to do around us. Whether you’re in the northwest or somewhere across the country, your home in **your community has a lot to offer.** I am constantly amazed at how we and I have put myself in this. We spend a whole lot of money on these houses, in these places that have so much to offer. And then, what do we do? We need to relax somewhere else, or we need to go entertain ourselves somewhere else. So I know I’m a bit of a homebody, and I do like projects, but one of the things I’m working on right now I remember I got that fence finished out, but I still needed to finish getting that root ball out.

See if I can put that there. Yeah, there we go. That’s probably the last motherlode of at least three routes I’ve taken out. And it’s just that it’s been a chore. But you know what? I just feel so accomplished. And it’s an awesome project. In the mornings here in the warm summertime, I go around, and I have a little walkabout, and I reacquaint myself with my yard because it’s a new yard to me this year. I get to see how things are blooming; what colors are coming up? I’ve got a rose of Sharon in the backyard that’s just starting to bloom. I’ve been watching the buds swell, and finally, they’re out. I’ll include a picture because they are just dainty and sweet. They’re precious. So.

In the meantime, I am still, for the most part, doing some work and family, getting things done, seeing my church family, and hanging out with a dog—actually, some more. We’re doing some walks, and that’s part of getting to know my neighborhood better. And it’s what I feel is fully enjoying and appreciating what I have here.

Another thing is that if you are out working in your yard**, you get a chance to see things before they get big**. So, I was able to notice that we had some blackberries coming from over next door, so I cut those back last night. It’s just little things that make it home, sweet home. What do they say? Be it ever so humble, there’s no place like home.

So I really hope you have a place that fits you, that makes you smile, that makes you feel like you can just wrap yourself up in it and have it as comfort, and safety, and security, and beauty, and all of that in a place if you want people to gather or if you want people to stay away. It’s your own little refuge. **I hope you have your home, sweet home.**<br>I can help you with that if you don’t. But in the meantime, have a super blessed day. Enjoy the rest of our summertime In the meantime, stay safe. Stay blessed, have a super blessed rest of your summer and let me know if there’s anything else we can help you with your real estate needs. **Contact me at (425) 422-7372 or send me an email at** [Sandy@SandyAndCompany.com](mailto:Sandy@SandyAndCompany.com)**.** Have a blessed day!
