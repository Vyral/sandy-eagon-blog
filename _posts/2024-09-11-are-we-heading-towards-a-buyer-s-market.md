Have you noticed a shift in our housing market lately? Homes are taking longer to sell, and prices are volatile nationwide. Depending on where you are, prices could start coming down for the first time in years. This has made many wonder, “Are we finally heading towards a buyer’s market?” My best answer is no; at least, not exactly. Instead, I’d say we’re more likely to head to a balanced market where both sellers and buyers have opportunities if they know what to look for. Here are three things you need to know about our market right now to make sure you get the best deal possible, whether you’re buying or selling:

**1\. Why is our market balancing out?** Despite record-high home prices and shrinking demand, prices aren’t falling in most areas of the country. While these conditions might make it seem like we’re heading for a buyer’s market, the truth is that prices are being kept in check due to low supply. Inventory has increased nationwide, but this hasn’t been enough to offset the persistent lack of supply in most markets. If inventory continues to rise, the market could eventually favor buyers; however, low supply and low demand are offsetting each other.

**2\. Condition matters.** In the current market, there is a huge gap between homes in good condition and those that need work. Due to affordability issues, buyers don’t have extra cash to make repairs after closing. If you don’t make the proper repairs before listing, you could suffer from a lack of demand that makes it feel like you’re in a buyer’s market. On the other hand, if you work with your agent to get your house ready for the market, multiple offers could come in quickly. You might even create a bidding war! Work with your agent and consider a pre-listing inspection, and you can still get an amazing deal on your house.

**3\. The market may speed up again soon.** While lower activity might make you think we’re heading for a buyers market, we have good reason to believe a shift is right around the corner. Due to worse job reports than expected, most experts believe the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates soon. This will make buying a home more affordable and spur new buyer demand. Tons of would-be buyers have been sitting out of the market waiting for rates to drop, so as soon as the news hits, we could see a fresh wave of demand.

There will be tons of competition when the Fed finally drops rates. If you want to avoid potential rate drops or are interested in a free pre-listing consultation, please call or email me. I am always willing to help!
