Just a note about how we can help you and the people you care about.&nbsp;

Yes, the market is super slow right now. Yes, we still have clients selling and buying right now. &nbsp;

But it’s not because they found a more exciting house or because they want to stretch out into four bedrooms with a den instead of their three-bedroom starter house. &nbsp;

Instead, they physically can’t keep up with house maintenance. Or the family no longer wants to travel that far to the 2nd home. Or they (and their two-year-old) had been sharing a two-bedroom apartment with in-laws. Or someone passed away.&nbsp;

**This is a “Needs” market. Not a “Wants” market.** &nbsp;

Two things this market does for you as our client.&nbsp;

First, Sarah and I are scouring the small number of homes available. **We’re finding the best opportunities for our buyers.** Sometimes we even get the sellers to pay for our buyers’ closing costs. Ask us how that works to keep more cash in your pocket up-front. We’re getting contingent offers accepted. And we even had a seller agree to finance the purchase for one of our buyers. (Now that’s still unusual- but it happened!)&nbsp;

Second, we’re taking more phone calls about how to help you stay in your home with peace of mind. **If you don’t want to move yet, let us problem-solve with you to stay.** I met with two estate attorneys last month so I could give personal recommendations to one of my sweet widow clients. Today I gave other clients their home’s value so they can restructure debt and could provide their home’s equity (with more than a guess).

We’re not new to real estate, and we’re not backing out now. If you’re looking for a Realtor team who is fully engaged and ready to put 20 years of experience to work on your needs, call us at 425-422-7372 or you can email us at [Sandy@SandyAndCompany.com](mailto:Sandy@SandyAndCompany.com).&nbsp;
