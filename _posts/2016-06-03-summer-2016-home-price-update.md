Clients and friends,

I have an important update for you about the value of your home.

If you’ve been following the news, the Federal Reserve is likely to raise interest rates when they meet on June 15th.

It’s been all over the news these past few weeks.

[Why the Federal Reserve has to raise interest rates](http://nypost.com/2016/05/23/why-the-federal-reserve-has-to-raise-interest-rates/)
This makes it more expensive for people to own a home by raising their mortgage payments.

It also decreases your pool of buyers thus lowering your home value.

Further, after a 6-year record run up in home prices since the 2008-2009 recession, **this may be the last year to get the maximum price on your home sale.**

It’s likely we’ll see a market correction next year.

We’re still seeing neighborhoods with very tight inventory. This means if you list your home for sale, it will sell quickly and in many neighborhoods above asking price.

**I write you because this summer is the best year to sell your home to get the maximum price.**

If you are thinking about selling your home, I have a special gift for you…

It’s the latest housing data from the market. It will give you a good guideline of where the market is going but at the end of the day, the best way to get up-to-date information about the market is by speaking with an expert, like the members of our team.

You can find out what your home is worth right now based on your neighbor’s recent home sale price.


Want to know what your home would sell for today?

[Enter your home address here to learn what price your home is worth.](http://sandyandcompany.blogspot.com/p/home-value-report.html)

With a short visit to your home, I’ll fill you in on what price it will sell for today at no charge.   

We’ve worked with many home buyers recently and know exactly what people are looking for in the hottest homes.

My estimates are right on the money.

And not to worry - if you’re thinking about buying a new home, I’ll share with you the neighborhoods where home prices are now more affordable.

You may be able to live in a nicer area you previously thought unaffordable.

I can also help you secure a low, fixed rate mortgage without junk fees with a minimal down payment.

I’ll put you in touch with my best preferred lenders.

**Anyway, I write you since we’re wrapping up one of the hottest home selling seasons ever.**

Our economy is normalizing, interest rates are rising, and pent-up demand following the 2008-2009 recession is less. This is the summer to sell your home.
