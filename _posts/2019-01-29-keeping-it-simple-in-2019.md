With buying and selling real estate, there is so much going on. So how do we really narrow down what’s most important? That’s what we’re talking about today.

Christmastime that we just passed through is an excellent time to give us an example of how to keep it simple. Keep it simple, sweetie, right?

What did we do with our family at Christmastime? We got to talk about Jesus, which is our favorite story to tell, we saw our family, whether they were coming to see us or we were going to see them, and Don and I also talked about what’s most important for 2019 and what we can do to get there.

**Keep it simple and keep the top priority the top priority.&nbsp;**

In just the same way, I am working for my clients whether they are looking to sell their house or to buy. We have to talk about what is most important about this investment: Is it the space? Is it the security? Is it what it’s going to do for their life—whether it’s going to shorten their commute or allow them to provide for other family members? What will it do for your life? So keep it simple and keep it the most important.

As we’re going into this shifting market, we are also committed to you. We are committed to helping one more family every month get the home of their dreams, the home that really works for them, in 2019 than we did in 2018.

So when you are talking with your friends and family and you hear someone is thinking of selling or buying, would you give us a call? Let’s talk about how to get them what's most important in their home in 2019—whether it’s that space, that security, what it will do for their life, and how we can help them keep what’s most important. Remember that through that process; it can be hairy, so we’ll make it better.

I'm so looking forward to a great 2019 keeping the most important priority the most important!!
