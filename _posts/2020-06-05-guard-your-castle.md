<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here are my tips on how to safeguard your home’s equity.</em></p>

In these uncertain times, the longer we go, the more uncertain it gets. We have got to be thinking about how we can be conservative and do well by our home and our family.

One of the biggest ways that I’ve found is to guard and increase the equity in your home. There are several ways you can do that.

So when you’re first purchasing, what can you do to get money into that home? **Zero down loans are great; they help you get a foot into the door.** The way that values are moving, that’s going to be important just to get in the game. Start working on your equity right away. Do everything you can to pay that loan down quickly—just because you got a 30-year loan doesn’t mean it has to take you 30 years to pay it off. **Do everything you can to get more space in between what you owe and the value of your home.**

Third, do everything you can to keep your home in great repair. There’s actually a chair right up on my deck up there. I sat in that thing and it just went. I know that’s very poetic, but it fell apart. And initially, I was thinking that we were going to have to go ahead and throw it away, but my husband, the handyman that he is, was able to show me how we can go ahead and glue it and screw on some braces and whatever it is that he’s going to do.
