We're all very busy in our lives. We have work to do, people to see, and probably a million other odds and ends that we need to accomplish. This is why today I'll be speaking with my coach about being more purposeful in order to improve my personal life, my professional life, and my spiritual life.

One of the most important parts of being patient is slowing down enough to listen to God prompting us to go one direction or another. We like to think that we know exactly what to do, and we often do know what to do. But sometimes God is asking us to go a different direction. So, sometimes our first reactions aren't the best ones for us, and we don't always hear him until afterwards when it's too late. And then we miss out on the better plans that he has for us.

I'd like to share what the Lord is working on with me right now regarding patience and listening and having a soft heart that hears and follows his direction. Hopefully this video encourages you in your walk, and I'd love to hear how he's working in your heart as well.

If you have any comments or questions about this, please don't hesitate to contact me and I'll be sure to get back to you quickly.
