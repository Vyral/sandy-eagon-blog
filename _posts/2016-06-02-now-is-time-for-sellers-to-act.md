If you’re in the Puget Sound area and haven’t been able to sell your home in the last few years because your value isn’t quite where you want it to be, we’ve got some great information to share with you.

A homeowner reached out to me about a month and a half ago. They had tried to sell last year, but they owed more than their market value. When they'd bought, they needed all 3200 square feet: they had three children at home and were holding church services in their bonus room. But now it was time to downsize, both for size and money. The husband had just changed jobs and travels a lot, so they weren’t even sure whether Snohomish County was where they wanted to be. Two of the three children are moving out in the fall. Their budget was stretched, the market is peaking, and they knew it was time to sell.

After looking at the home, we decided that if the home was going to sell, this was the market to do it in. We did our full marketing blitz, including personally inviting the neighbors to our open house that had about 30 buyers go through. We really pushed the top of the market with our price, and we were hoping for one or two good offers. We had several people come through multiple times, and the right buyer showed up.

We secured a full-price offer for our sellers, and the home sale just closed. This family decided to rent so they have the flexibility to decide where they want to settle in the next year. They have 1,500 less square feet to clean, pay $1,000 less per month on their rent, and they accomplished all of this in today’s market.

We are at the peak of the market, the growth is slowing. There’s a shift coming up, so your top window of opportunity in this market is closing. Who do you know who we can help with our expert service and proven systems to get top dollar?

If you or someone you know has been wondering whether it’s the right time to sell, we would be happy to talk to you. Just give us a call or send us an email and we’ll be in touch!
