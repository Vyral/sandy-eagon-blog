As we near the end of spring and begin to enter summer, I thought it would be useful to provide you with a real estate market update.

Currently, inventory is shifting a little bit, but inventory is still very, very low and buyers are squirming to find good homes. We actually only have 1.3 months of inventory right now. However, we expect a seasonal rise in inventory to help buyers find good homes. For sellers, this means that you have a very good opportunity to find a buyer willing to pay top dollar.

Prices are still going up, but interest rates are starting to rise. For sellers, this means that you need to price your home so that many different buyers can afford your home if you want to capture the largest possible audience. Homes that are priced well and in good condition are selling very well, and sometimes even for more than the asking price. However, buyers are more savvy than they used to be and they will not overpay for homes very often unless they are really in love with a property.

The important thing to remember is to price your home correctly when you're selling, because even though inventory is low, buyers aren't willing to pay a whole lot extra.

Hopefully this information is useful to you if you're planning on buying or selling a home in Puget Sound this summer. Please contact me with any questions you may have!
