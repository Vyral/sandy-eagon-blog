<p style="text-align: center;"><em>In these uncertain times, life seems to change every single day. So what’s next for real estate?</em></p>

A couple weeks ago, I spoke with a client who worked in sales. He told me he'd been laid off. When I asked how he’s doing, he told me that he’ll be okay because his landlords wouldn’t be able to evict him for quite some time. 

If you decide that you can't make your mortgage or rent payment , PLEASE understand there may be no turning back. Stimulus aside, don’t believe that the government alone will carry us through this crisis.
