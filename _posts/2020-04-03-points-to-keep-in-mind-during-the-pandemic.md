In these uncertain times, life seems to change every single day. So what’s next for real estate?

A couple of weeks ago, I spoke with a client who worked in sales and who told me he had been laid off. When I asked how he’s doing, he told me that he’s okay because his landlords wouldn’t be able to evict him for quite some time. If you determine that you cannot make your mortgage or rent payment , just understand that, if you decide not to pay, there may be no turning back.

Even though a $2-trillion stimulus package helps, don’t believe that the government alone will carry us through this crisis. You’ll also need the support of your neighborhood and community.

To see my full message about what we need to keep in mind as we navigate the pandemic, watch &nbsp;the video above.
