<p style="text-align: center;"><em>I’m sharing my personal experiences of surviving the economic collapse of the Great Recession and what I learned from it. Here’s how those lessons are applicable now.</em></p>

Today we're talking about what we're going to do next...  this video very well may be outdated by the time you get it because, as you know, **life is changing moment by moment**, and certainly day by day, but what can we expect right now? 

A couple weeks ago, I spoke with a client who worked in sales. He told me he'd been laid off. When I asked how he’s doing, he told me that he’ll be okay because his landlords wouldn’t be able to evict him for quite some time. If you decide that you can't make your mortgage or rent payment, please understand there may be no turning back. As many of you know, 2007 through 2014 were not very helpful for me, and I don't make any illusion that we had it all together during that time. 

In fact, we pretty much lost everything— and I mean everything. I got my kids, and other than that, pretty much everything else is gone. So please, if you decide that you cannot
make that mortgage payment, if you decide that you cannot make that rent payment, you have to do it knowing that there may be no turning back. You have to do it knowing that the mortgage company may not give you the assistance that really works for you. 

Mortgage companies were not our friends during that time, and I'd be surprised if this particular leopard changes spots, so one of the things that was important to me during the darkest time of my adult life is knowing that I may be in a fog right now, but someday that fog will lift; I want to know that I got to a different place from the beginning of it until the end, such that I could look up and look behind me and know that I had actually made progress during that time, even when I couldn't see it.

Here's the thing people: Do everything you can. Please don't take it for granted that the government is going to take care of us through this, that your neighborhoods are going to
take care of you through this— your neighbors, your friends… Do everything that you possibly can because you may be making decisions that you don't know the long-term consequences of. 

If you have questions, give me a call, I'll give you my advice. I'll give you my experience and I'll let you know what we can do for you right now. **Real estate is still happening**; I've been
actually working from home, and so I have not been working out in the yard a whole lot because my people need care. If there's anything I can do for you, please let me know if there's any advice they can share with you on next steps to take.

I am more than happy to do that, whether it's from my personal experience or from
the expertise of my team around me. Have an amazing day! Stay safe, be blessed, and I will talk with you soon!
