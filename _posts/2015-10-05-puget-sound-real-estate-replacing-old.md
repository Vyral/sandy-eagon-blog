Sellers will commonly ask me whether they should get an entire new roof or can they  just put a second layer of composition shingles on top. Putting an entire new roof on a home is expensive, so this is a very important question.

{% include pullquote.html %}
If you have composition shingles on your roof, you can either replace sections of it, replace all of it, or put a new layer over the old layer, but this depends on multiple factors. One way to tell if you need to remove the old before putting on the new is to look at the edges of the roof and up in your attic crawlspace. If you can see rot or damage on the plywood sheeting, you should remove and replace it along with the new layer of shingles.

It's important to keep in mind that cutting corners like  covering up rotten plywood will send messages to the buyer that you've been cutting a lot of corners and covering up problems elsewhere in your home. When it comes to something as important as your roof, it's best to do the job right.

If you have any more questions or concerns about this issue, please don't hesitate to contact me. I look forward to speaking with you!
