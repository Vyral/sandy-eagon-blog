Do you have a project that you're waiting to complete because you don't have the right tools? Depending on what you need, tools can be extremely expensive.

Luckily, I have collected some tools from my sellers, and you're able to rent them from me as long as you sign a release. We have ladders, carpet cleaners, and more.

I recently got a hold of an extension ladder that fits in your car and stands up to twelve feet tall. You can paint vaulted ceilings or underneath your eaves. I'm happy to let you to use these items; all you have to do is contact me!

Please let me know which tools you're looking for- I'm gathering the equipment that people need most.

As always, please contact me if you're looking to buy or sell in Puget Sound.
