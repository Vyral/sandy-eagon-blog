Life is like a box of chocolates, or maybe it’s like a bowl of cherries. Sometimes making big life decisions is like the Now and Later candy: all of the life decisions that you make have something to do with now and something to do with later. So, how do you make those big decisions?

Some people  can make a snap decision, jump right in, and everything turns out OK. Even when buying a home. Most of us take a slower pace. I want to encourage you to do three things when making those big decisions:

**1. Slow down to be wise.** Often we can be distracted by the shiny and beautiful surfaces. We don’t always look to see what’s underneath. That can happen in all arenas of life. Let me encourage you to take a harder look and make sure that what you see is really what you get.

**2. Pray about it.** Ask God, “What is it that you have for me and how does this fit in?” Don’t be afraid of his answer. He might say no because he has something better in store for you later on. But he might actually say yes! Then you can be excited that you are being wise and that you are walking along the purpose he has designed for you as your creator.

**3. Talk to others.** Talk to your spouse, parents, friends, or whomever you know who has a wise demeanor in this arena. Ask what they think about it. When I am looking at homes with single people, they don’t always have another person to talk things over with and bounce ideas off. In that case, I am honored to be on their “Board of Directors” and to help them weigh their options.

When considering a home, there are several things you need to keep in mind. For instance, does it make you smile when you walk in the door? Is the property structurally sound? The house might be really pretty, but if the bones weren't taken care of, then you have a problem. You should also consider whether or not you have the resources for upkeep down the road.

So when you make those big decisions, look at Now and Later. Go through a decision-process to ensure that you make a great decision now that will still be a great decision down the road.
