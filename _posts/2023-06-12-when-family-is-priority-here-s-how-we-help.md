Hey there, Sandy with Sandy and Company, and today we're talking about “Can you get your needs met in today's real estate market?” We hear so many stories. Rates are going up, rates are coming down, prices are going down, prices are going up, competitive offers. **What's the real story? And the answer is that it really depends.** Let me tell you about one of our clients.

She wanted to live next door to her sister. She actually lived in the same complex, but wanted to live in the building with her sister right next door, and it didn't hurt that it has a pretty amazing view of the valley, and it's just going to be a great place to live. So we sat down and looked at numbers and said, this is what would make sense.

If you sell your condo for X, then you can buy the next condo for Y, and it makes sense to go ahead and do that, as you're looking at retiring and settling down to a little bit of a smaller income. She needed to make sure the numbers made sense, and we listed her condo. We had a good amount of traffic for the first week and a half, and then it got really quiet for the rest of the month and the next month and most of the next month until we were right at the very end, and we said, you know, hey, we tried. The market just didn't bear what we needed to make it happen.

And then, all of a sudden, we had a flurry of activity. Two offers, full price for where we are at. And guess what? Next week she's moving. She's going to live right next door to her sister with the amazing view. So the answer is, it depends. Let's talk. Let's make sure that the numbers make sense for you. And if this is a move that your heart is set on, that your finances are set on, that something needs to happen to make life work better, let's talk and see what we can do to help you get there because **we want you to be in a home that feels like home.**

Let us know how we can help. Reach out. Let's talk about how we can solve your issues with your home and get you where you really want to be. Have a super day. Be blessed. Be healthy. We're excited to talk with you about your real estate needs and make it happen for you now in a way that makes sense for you even later. Be blessed.
