Hey, this is Sandy with Sandy and Company. You may think that because it’s February and the sun is not shining and warm it may be time to still stay inside for a little bit longer, but this is actually the perfect time to get your yard and your garden ready. I’ve got three tips for you to do right now before it gets warm.

I confess that I have been inside baking bread and enjoying my cooking shows and my knitting, and I’ve been looking outside going, “Man, I think there are a few things I need to do, but I’m not quite ready to start.” Well, here are three easy things that won't take me a lot of time, and as you’ll see, I am not done with them. They still have to go, but in the next couple of weeks, my intent is to knock those things out.

**The first thing we need to do is trim these fruit trees.** You might be able to see. If you look at it, you can kind of see where it’s rounded and where the growth is—the lots of little twigs—and where it just goes straight up. Take a look at that shape, and you can see where it really wants to trim back to so that you can have nice, diverse branches coming out and nothing that looks dead.&nbsp;

Take anything away that looks dead, and take anything away that’s cutting across another branch. They actually want to have their own space. If you don’t have trimmers, that’s actually something that I can lend you. I’ve got trimmers for some really tall trees. There’s a clip and there’s a saw part of it that would be really helpful there. But do it before the sap starts coming into the branches and before the buds open up. So this is perfect fruit tree trimming time. Say that five times fast with braces\!

**The next thing is to get rid of dead stuff.** Now, I actually have over here, I’m actually embarrassed to show you, but I actually have sunflowers that are dead and just sitting there, and they got to go. Anything that’s dead that's a perennial, cut it back. If it’s an annual, take it away completely.&nbsp;

While you’re there, go ahead and pull out some of those green weeds that are coming through, and just make some good space for the new plants to come up, and decide what it is that you want to keep and what you want to take out. Now is the time.

The third thing you can do is actually for the life around your garden. **Take a look at your bird feeders; clean them up.** Let’s see, what do we got here? My son gave me this bird feeder for Christmas. Thank you\! And of course, we’ve got our hummingbird feeder over here. We've tried several that are even fancier, but they really just like that flat bottom, red one. And so, give them a lift. Give them a lift, clean them out, and make sure that they’ve got enough food to get it through until they can really start getting some food on our trees. Here’s a suet cup right. I think it’s—sorry, I’m a little backward here. There's a cup that one of my clients (thank you, Caroline) gave me that the birds are really getting into. It’s filled with suet.

So, now’s the time to just make your space clean and fresh and ready for the new green stuff to come up. Take a look at your yard. I am not going to bore you and fill up your inbox with every time I get one of these things done, but [**take a look at our Facebook or our Sandy & Company page.**](https://www.facebook.com/SandyandCompany/videos/?ref=page_internal){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} And that will be my accountability to you and make sure I get this done in the next little bit before everything starts to grow, and I go, “Oh my gosh, I really wish I could just be seeing what I really wanted to see that makes my garden and my yard beautiful.”

There you go\! Have a super blessed day\! Enjoy your homes. Your home is the palace for you to thrive and a place for you to really just stretch out and say, “This is, this is what looks and feels good around me.” This is what we want for you. If you don’t feel that way about your home, talk to me. I would love to see what we could to help you either love your home or find one that you will. This is now the time; it’s an awesome time to buy and sell real estate. Give me a call. Have a super blessed day\! Stay healthy\! Stay safe. We love you, and we look forward to talking with you soon. Be blessed.
