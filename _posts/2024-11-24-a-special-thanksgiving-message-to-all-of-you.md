Happy Thanksgiving, everyone! As we enter the Thanksgiving season and reflect on what we’re thankful for, I want to share a few things that are important to me.

I once took a class where we rated our values, and the big ones they took away because they assumed that we all had them in the close order up top: God, family, and health. I am 100% grateful for those, but I want to move on to a few more that might surprise you.

Our new bathroom window, which I thought I would use to signify that I am incredibly grateful for hot running water. I know that’s very simple, but there's something about stepping into a hot shower and covering yourself in that comfort, which is a blessing. **Everyone needs a way to be able to move into softness, warmth, and comfort** that makes them say it’s going to be okay. For me, hot running water is definitely that symbol of comfort and technology that has made our lives infinitely better.

I love hearty fuchsia flowers. To me, they are that spot of color. They start out strong in summer, but as everything else starts to get a little darker or a little drier, leaves start falling, and trees become more bare, we can come back to that spot of color. **We need these bright spots in our lives that bring us joy.** These things are things that we are not seeking out, but when we come across them, they are great and fabulous. It makes us smile and happy. I am very grateful for my hearty fuchsia flowers.

This next one may surprise you the most: I am actually grateful for messes. **Messes are proof that we are alive.** We are in a community with others, and things are happening. Hopefully, progress is being made like the mess from my construction. I have more mess out in the carport and the new bedroom and bathroom area.

This mess is proof that I have great people working alongside me. When I see the extension cord lying there, I’m not thinking, "Oh my gosh, the extension cord is cluttering up my deck." Instead, I think, "Wow, I have great electricians I can rely on and plumbers who need that extension cord for their work." I am so grateful that they are here.

A quick little update on my bedroom and bathroom: they actually look pretty tidy at the moment. They're framed in, and we have a permit inspector coming this afternoon for the electrical, and a mechanical inspection that is scheduled for tomorrow. So, things are happening.

Here’s the bottom line: **I love life, I love my people, and I love my tribe.** I am so grateful for the comfort and beauty, even the trouble that the dog can cause. Ultimately, they are all part of a life worth living.

Thank you so much to each of you who are part of what I’ve been able to create. It wouldn’t be the same without you—not a single bit of it. I am super grateful. As you gather to give thanks this Thanksgiving, I hope it’s with family, friends, and people who are important to you. Remember that life is good, and we are blessed.
