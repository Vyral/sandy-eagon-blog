Recently, a client had to move out of town before they sold their property. They needed someone here in Puget Sound to manage the home sale, and we were happy to fulfill their need.

We marketed their home aggressively in many ways, including knocking on doors to let neighbors know about the new listing.

It was a nice ranch-style rambler with a three-car garage and an open back yard. When we held an open house, several neighbors came through and we ended up getting three offers on the property! We negotiated and accepted the best offer for our client.

That very night, the house was broken into. Fortunately a neighbor noticed and called us- we called our client and then the police immediately. Whoever broke in had started setting up a drug operation. We cleaned up the house, posted signs that the house was being watched and instructed the neighbors to call 911 immediately and us second this time. No need, our prompt response let the drug makers know they should go elsewhere.

After this happened, we coordinated with the police to make sure that only certain people were allowed in the home. The neighbors kept a great eye on the house, and we had a lot of conversations to make sure everyone was safe.

That is one downside to vacant homes. Unfortunately, they are vulnerable to break-ins. Luckily, we were here to repair the damage and make a plan to prevent further incidents.

We moved smoothly to closing until the last weekend. They seller's car broke down so he couldn't get here to finish the final clean up and dump runs. We had promised the buyer in the contract that the house would be clean and ready. So my team hired a handyman service to haul everything out and leave the home tidy.

After the house sold, our client was able to make an offer on a new house in Spokane. The agent we set him up with got him ready to go with his new home.

We have a hands-on approach to real estate. If you know anyone who is thinking of buying or selling a home, please call or email us for an introduction. As always, if you have any real estate questions, give us a call or send us an email.

We look forward to hearing from you!
