A while back, I worked with some attorneys who ran into a sticky situation. The long story short is that they needed to sell their home quickly. The home itself was a project home with lots of repairs that needed to be done, but the owners didn't have the time or resources to put in the necessary repairs.

We eventually listed it as a home that needed some elbow grease, and we listed it at a fair market value compared to the other fixer-uppers in the area. When we advertised it as a property that needed some love, we had every home flipper and investor in the area wanting to take a look at it.

In two days we had fifteen offers on the home! We got a full price offer in the first twenty minutes, and eventually we had an offer that was $20,000 over the asking price.

My question for you is: who do you know out there who wants to sell their home quickly and for top dollar?
