Welcome back, old friend!

What makes now a great time to be a buyer who also has a house to sell in our market?&nbsp;

In a rushed market, people sometimes don’t have time to achieve all of their real estate goals. So many of my clients over the past couple years have been concerned that they can’t sell their current home because they won’t be able to find their next home. They need more bedrooms, more space, more room to park, etc. They’ve been living in smaller homes that function okay for them but aren’t really what they need for their family.&nbsp;

Here’s the kicker, though: Last month I was searching for shop homes for my clients—homes with at least three- or four-car garages—and I noticed that **in the $400,000 to $500,000 price range, there were a lot of sellers that had accepted contingent offers.** Sellers are realizing that in order to still get the price they want, they need to be willing to allow buyers to sell their homes first.&nbsp;

So welcome back contingent offers!

**If you need to sell your current home before you can buy your best home, call me** so we can make a plan. Then you can transition smoothly and seamlessly between homes.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions about our market or you have any other real estate needs, feel free to reach out to me as well. I’d love to speak to you.
