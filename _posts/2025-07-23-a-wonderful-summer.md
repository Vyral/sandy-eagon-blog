Hi Friends!

This has been a wonderful summer for me. My son Tony married his sweetheart Corina and I couldn’t be more pleased for them both. They’re both in their early 30’s, and they’ve been very intentional about their criteria for romantic relationships. They’re in this for a lifetime, and they knew their choices mattered.

I heard the word “intentional” about both Tony and Corina from more lips than I could count over the wedding weekend. Tony and Corina both had lists of qualities for a spouse. Long lists. And both were counseled to shorten their lists, but neither one did.

Our intentions matter. The results are never guaranteed, but if our intention is kind, usually it will show. If our intention is to help others, it will show. If our intention is for ourselves at the expense of others, that will usually show as well. We see this around us all the time.

Tony and Corina didn’t know what the future held, and neither had a straight road to each other. But God’s plan and will was first on each of their list, and they were intentional in their actions to follow through for everyone’s better good in the future.

Have a beautiful rest of your summer. Enjoy your families and friends at whatever age and stage they are right now. And of course if you have any real estate needs, please reach out. We’re glad to help. Intentionally.

Blessings to you and yours,

**Sandy**
