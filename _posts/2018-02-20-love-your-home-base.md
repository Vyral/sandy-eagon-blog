During the wet windy winter months, I like to hunker down in my home base and enjoy some of my favorite activities.&nbsp;

**Whether it’s reading a good book, like John Eldredge’s “Moving Mountains,” journaling, or knitting,** I have been really enjoying making the most of my downtime. And of course for my yarn I go to [Great Yarns](https://www.greatyarns.com/) in Everett.&nbsp;

Another thing I’m rarely without when I am home is a cup of tea. You’ve got to check out [Everything Tea](http://www.everythingtea.net/) down on First Street. While you’re there you’ll find old favorites and new flavors.

If you’re feeling adventurous enough to brave the winter weather, all it takes is a good stocking cap and rain gear to stay warm. We were just golfing over at<br>**[Battle Creek Golf Course](http://battlecreekgolfwa.com/)** in the chill. There is so much to do in the Pacific Northwest, even during these cool, wet days.&nbsp;

And if your house doesn't feel like home base, call me!<br>**Maybe it's time for a new house that feels like a good place to call home.**

As always, feel free to give me a call or send me an email if you have any questions about real estate or anything I’ve mentioned here today. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
