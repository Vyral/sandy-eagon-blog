  If you’re purchasing a new construction home, do you still need an agent
  working on your behalf? Actually, yes—and this means hiring a Realtor of your
  own rather than simply following the advice of the one who’s working for the
  builders.

Buyers often assume they won’t need to have a Realtor on their side when buying new construction. After all, the agent working with the builders has all the information they could need, right?

Actually, while this agent may be knowledgeable, it’s important to realize that they are not working on your behalf. They have the builders’ best interests in mind—not yours.

As in the case of any home purchase, you still need to have an agent on your side when purchasing new construction. Having strong representation will help make sure you understand all the fine details of the process as they relate to you and your needs.

Also, the agent working on behalf of the builders won’t likely alert you to any of the unnecessary expenses you can avoid when they present the cost of the new home. The beauty of new construction homes is that they are highly customizable.

However, customizing a home can quickly rack up a high price tag. Partnering with an agent of your own is the best way to make sure you aren’t paying for features you don’t want or that are outside of your budget.

If you don’t already have a trusted Realtor in mind, I would love to speak to you about how I help my clients save thousands during new construction purchases. You don’t know what you don’t know. But, as someone who works through transactions like this every day, I am very familiar with the ins and outs of new construction purchases. I would be happy to guide you through yours.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
