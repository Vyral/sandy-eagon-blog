Christmastime is here, and I spent a lot of time thinking about where to shoot this video, what to say, what I should wear, and all that prep stuff.

And then I thought, ya know? Christ himself didn’t enter this world in a fancy suit or in a fancy place or with a fancy decorated tree. He came for us in a stable and was very humble. So I came out in my everyday jacket and sweater next to the Snohomish River, where I like to walk, and I'm saying in my normal everyday way, I am grateful for you.

I’ve got an amazing life and amazing family and amazing clients, and I have been blessed in so many ways to have an amazing year. I hope that you have time this Christmas that you can spend with the people that you can be in your "everyday" with, be yourself and be blessed and be filled with joy and love.

Thank you so much for being a part of my life. I love you, and I'm so excited to look forward to 2019 and see what it brings both of us.

Have a blessed Christmas. Every day.
