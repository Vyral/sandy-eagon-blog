We’ve been working throughout the surrounding Puget Sound area and the market is the same in every county! There are hardly any houses for sale. Instead of talking about inventory in terms of months, now we're talking about it in terms of weeks: we have about five to seven weeks of inventory. If nothing new came on for sale, that’s how long it’d take to sell every house in our MLS.
