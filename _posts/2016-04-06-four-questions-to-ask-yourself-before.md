Moving from one property to another is a major decision for yourself and your family. It’s difficult to tell when the right time to sell is, but you can come closer to your answer by asking yourself a few tough questions.

* Consider some of these questions:
* If you could live anywhere, where would it be?
* Why aren’t you there yet?
* If you sell in 5-10 years, will you wish that you'd sold sooner?
* Is now the time?

If you need a professional to consult with, please don’t hesitate to contact me. This is not a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ decision, and sometimes this answer cannot come from you alone. I would be happy to consult with you to determine an appropriate time for you and your family to sell.

Keep in mind that we expect a great spring selling season, so talk to us as soon as possible if you’re interested!
