When this client needed help to fix a problem, my team was there.

Today I’d like to share how we helped a client fix a problem.&nbsp;

A couple of years ago, one of my former neighbors was talking with me about this home that he used to live in that he was currently renting to his daughter and her family at a very subsidized rate. He was ready to be done with that and to get that house off of his shoulders and off of the things he had to think about and continue paying for on a monthly basis.&nbsp;

The first question was whether his daughter could buy the house. I connected him with my lender and he talked with both the daughter and her family, as well as my client, Charlie, and his wife, and they decided that it really wasn’t the best option. It wasn’t going to work for them in the long run.&nbsp;

So, they moved out and it was time to sell. The house needed a little work, but it cleaned up real nicely and it didn’t take long—even at the beginning of COVID-19. **In less than a week, we got three offers and we accepted one with a strong buyer that was over asking price.** Things went really well. The inspection was OK, but as we knew, because it needed some work, there were a few things that came up. My seller agreed to pay for electrical, plumbing, and to have the rodents out.

That’s when I called my people. I have a great electrician, a great plumber, and a fabulous clean-out guy who came and did all the work and got paid for it out of closing when my seller actually had the funds readily available. They were incredibly relieved to know that this work was taken care of for them, that they didn’t have to give the money up front, and that their buyer was going to be well cared for in a great house that’s going to serve them for many years to come—happy all around\! We are solutions-oriented.&nbsp;

**Who’s the next person you know who’s looking for that Realtor who’s both patient (this took a couple of years, remember) and efficient?** We’ve got the resources and we have the connections to make sure it’s a great experience for you and that what needs to happen happens. Send me their contact information and we’ll take great care of them because that is what we do for you and for everyone you care about.&nbsp;

Have an amazing day, be blessed, stay healthy, and I look forward to talking to you when there’s anything that I can do for real estate.
