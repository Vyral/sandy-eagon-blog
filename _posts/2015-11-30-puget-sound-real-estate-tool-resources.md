In my tool shed at home, I made some additions and improvements. I’d like to share them with you today.

Recently, I added a pegboard space to organize tools in my shed. I picked it out at a local hardware store. With saws, we were able to cut it to fit the size of our wall.

If you’re looking for any home tools, please talk to me! I can help you out. I’d love to share my resources with you. Don’t rent it out. I have plenty of tools that I’m willing to loan out to the community. Don't be afraid to ask!

As always, please don't hesitate to reach out to me with any and all of your real estate questions. Please reach out by phone or email!
