Whether you are renting or your current home doesn’t meet your family’s needs, I have good news. It just got easier to purchase a home again. In fact, there are three great options for buyers in today’s market.

First of all, let me say that I am not a mortgage expert. I have several lenders that I can put you in touch with who will take phenomenal care of you.

That said, my mortgage broker recently told me that the **FHA lowered their mortgage insurance** for every loan that closes after January 27th, which will save you a lot of money. In fact, I have a buyer who will save $60 a month, or $21,000 over the life of her loan!

If you don’t want to get an FHA loan but you don’t want to have mortgage insurance for the life of your loan, a local banker told me about a great new conventional loan product. This product allows you to put 3% down and you only have to pay mortgage insurance for the time that you exceed 80% of loan to value. Not only that, the mortgage insurance is less than the FHA’s mortgage insurance.

Finally, if you are currently renting your home, I can help you get into the home that you would like to purchase now. Many renters want to wait one, three, or five years before buying a home. There is a program available that allows you to pick the house that works for you and then rent it back from a company for up to five years. You know exactly what the rent will be, you know exactly what the purchase price will be, and, if it makes sense for you, in five years **you will have the option to buy the home you already get to live in.**

We want to make sure that the home you come to every night is the place that makes you feel most comfortable at the end of each day. If you are interested in owning a home, give me a call. I would be happy to help you!
