Hey there! This is Sandy with Sandy and Company. And today we are talking about three considerations when you are looking to move out of state.

If you can see my house, it is a little disheveled. This is what it looks like three days before moving day, and I'm not even moving out of state, I'm just moving three cities away. My seller, on the other hand, is moving to Tennessee, and she's had to consider even more than I have. So three things I want you to think about if you're considering another state, or if you're moving to Washington is:

Number one, what is your budget? It is a lot of money to move. **And even if you're doing it yourself on the cheap, you're still probably going to spend about five grand to go from one side of the country to another.** I understand the recent moving bids she got to go to Tennessee were in the range of about $18,000. So it obviously can go very high and very quickly.

Secondly, do you still need to work? Are you retired? Are you going just for the relaxation and the people that you are around? Or do you also have work there? Are you remote? If you're remote, are you going to have good internet? If you're not remote, do you already have a job lined up, or do you need to start looking for something once you're there, or are you looking before you go?<br>

Keep in mind if you are looking too, next big point, **think about where you will live if you need to get a mortgage because you're looking to buy and you need to work there.** We need to talk about the order of events because you need to have something lined up before the mortgage company is going to say, “Yes, let me give you hundreds of thousands of dollars for a loan because you need to have a way to pay it back.”

And thirdly, like I referenced the home. Do you know exactly where you want to be? **Would you like to rent for a little while to check out the area, or are you ready to zero in and purchase right away?** Do you have a realtor to help you once you're there?

I connect my clients with great realtors all over the country. Recently, I've connected realtors with clients in California, in Tennessee, and Florida, and up in Maine.

So if you are looking to purchase, I can put you in touch with someone who is ready to help you, and is great at what they do. Because if I'm going to give good service, I'm going to make sure that **wherever you get service in the other state, I'm going to make sure that you're getting great service as well.**

If you are looking to relocate into Washington State, I would love to help you. Sarah and I work most of Washington State. But if it's an area that we really feel like we just can't help you, well, we will find again that person who will.
