I want to talk to you about what's hot when it’s not.

As we enter January 2026, it’s cold out there, but fortunately, it doesn’t have to be that way inside our homes. Here are three things that I think are amazing when the weather is cold, and we want to make things warm and inviting inside our home:

**First, I love a good fire.** I really enjoy the smell and the crackle of the logs when you have a wood fireplace. But there is nothing that beats being able to turn on the flames with a flick of a switch.

I confess, I am really fond of having a gas fireplace. It brings me cozy warmth when I’m really cold.

**The second thing is my kitchen.** When we get those ovens heating up, and we're making cookies or bread or whatever else tickles our fancy, it warms the whole house. Even better, whether you’re cooking with someone or doing it in anticipation of the people you love coming home, that just makes it even better.

Give me some heat in the kitchen, good food, and the people I love to share it with; that is heat in my home.

**The third item is a bit more personal.** If you love a good, steamy shower or bath, that is another source of warmth on a chilly night. Run the tub and just slip in because there is nothing like that heat completely surrounding you and warming you up.

We’re in the Pacific Northwest. It’s chilly, but it doesn’t have to be in our home. So if you have this, enjoy it. Remember, using what you love really fosters the contentment of a good life.

And that’s what we love: having our homes reflect that life is good. It inspires us to help connect you with the right home that fits you. If you don’t have that, let’s talk. Whether it’s your first home or your next best fit, our joy is to connect you with a home you feel good coming home to, where you can share love, warmth, and joy.

If you’re worried about how cold the market is out there, 2026 is projected to be a year of stability. With stability comes better options.

If you have a home already and need to move up to the next best fit, we can work with that next seller to get you what you need and sell your last home. If you’re looking for your first home, we’re getting more closing costs covered and negotiating on price. This is the year that, if you can do it, let’s make it happen.
