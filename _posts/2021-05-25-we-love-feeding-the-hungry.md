Today we are talking about helping out our food bank. Yesterday was RED day, and **RED day at Keller Williams means that we are helping out in our community.**&nbsp;

And so, for me, I actually was just busy with some other things, and at the last minute, I realized I have done nothing to help our food drive. And so I just got on the phone yesterday, called about 40 of my top favorite people, and not all of them, trust me. If you didn’t get a call, it just meant that I was going to save you for next time. So, but if you did, I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart.&nbsp;

Sometimes people, it’s the right time to give, and sometimes I’ll catch them next time. And the people that did, **I picked up food and donations from almost 20 homes,** and lots of food here.&nbsp;

Let’s see, I’m looking into the sun, but my truck is full, my heart is full, and we picked up enough money that with me matching and our owner matching, we’re bringing in a little over $4,000 to the Marysville Food Bank. The summertime is kind of lean, especially for the kids. They need more than pb&js, and this is going to give them the ability to feed many families with good foods, good meals, meat, fresh fruits, and vegetables. Top Ramen is great, but you don’t want to make life on it.&nbsp;

If you’re in a spot, and if you’re able to give, free free to give me a call. I keep a bag going all the time. **Give me a call, and I will pick up or donate to your local food bank** if you know where it is and it’s easily accessible.&nbsp;

Have a super day. Bless the people around you. It really is the best way for you to get blessed in return. There really is nothing like going out and being face to face with people and having the opportunity to bless those who lift you up.

Have a super blessed day, stay healthy, be loved, be blessed, and I look forward to talking with you soon when I can help you with anything real estate or anything else. Take care.
