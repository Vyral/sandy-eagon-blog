Last month one of my neighbors told me that she was in a dire financial situation, as she was in pre-foreclosure. As it turns out, one of her family members who shares a joint account with her and assists her making her mortgage payments actually stole money from that account and lied about it.

Now this neighbor is a number of months late on her mortgage payment. She’s been consulting with an agent on how to rectify this situation and it sounds like her bank may help her. But I’m not sure she’s getting the results she’s looking for. Needless to say, I have many concerns for this dear lady. She has a significant amount of equity, so she can sell her home and put that equity into her next place, but what’s the next place that works best for her?
