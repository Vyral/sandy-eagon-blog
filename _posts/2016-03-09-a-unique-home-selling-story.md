Last fall we sold a very unique home- let me share. Originally listed with a different agent, the home sat on 3 acres inside Marysville, but the home was priced too high. The home and property were beautiful, but it had all the original features in it. It’s what we affectionately call vintage,requiring at least $60,000 in updating to make this home shine again.

We listed the property in the range to accommodate the repairs. We got lots of showings but everyone had a bigger number in their head for repairs, so we inched the price down just a little more. There was nothing else with acreage in-town, so we gave it a little longer and kept holding open houses. Within a few days, we got two full price offers and then a third offer willing to pay $5,000 above what anyone else put down.

When it was all said and done, we had three different offers resulting in $13,000 above the listed price. This was only days before we thought we were going to have to reduce the price!

So, what happened? We were patient and the market responded. We used all our marketing avenues, and the buyers who fell in love originally found us through our open house.

If you have a unique home to sell in Puget Sound, please don’t hesitate to contact us. It’s going to be a great year to sell a home!
