The Christmas season is a time for gratitude.

Today, my office manager Kerri is with me because we were just talking about what we’re grateful for.

**One of the main things we’re grateful for is the trust you put in us during your real estate transactions.** In these transactions there is so much at stake, so thank you for trusting us with those transactions and with your life. We are so grateful that we get to serve you and be a part of your life. Thank you for your trust.

Kerri is also grateful for the ability to help all of you. “I truly love my job, and I am grateful for the flexibility that comes with that,” says Kerri. “At times I’m even able to do my job from home and spend a bit more time with my family while still serving you and being there when you need us.”

So, we’d like to send you a great big thank you this Christmas. We are excited to see what’s coming up in 2018. **Have a wonderful Christmas and a great, safe New Year.**

If you have any questions, just give us a call. We look forward to seeing you in 2018!
