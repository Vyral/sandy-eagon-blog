One of the biggest misconceptions out there is that the winter is a bad time to sell a home. Today, I have three reasons this couldn't be further from the truth:

1. You have less competition in January. March and April are when inventory starts to increase. When buyers have more options, you are less likely to sell your home quickly and for top dollar. Listing now is a great way to avoid getting lost in the crowd.

2. Winter buyers are more motivated. In our part of the country, we get a lot of rain, wind, and sometimes snow in the winter. And yet, we still have people purchasing homes! This happens because there are always people that need to make a move in the next 30 days. The people out looking now are extremely serious about buying a home soon.

3. Your competition doesn't look perfect right now either. There aren't many homes on the market right now, and the ones that are don't look as good right now as they will later. Take advantage of this by making your home look spectacular right now!
