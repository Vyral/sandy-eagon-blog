<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here’s how we’re protecting our clients in this wild market of ours.</em></p>

With this market being so hot and houses selling so quickly, for so much money and with so few protections, it brings a lot of fear for both the sellers and the buyers. We’ve done a lot of things over the last few months to cool that down for all of our clients—there’s a lot of worry on both sides. Many sellers are concerned that they’re either going to be left homeless, or that in order to complete a transaction they’re going to have to do a whole lot of repairs that may not be necessary.&nbsp;

For one of our sellers right now, we actually had a buyer who was looking for just *their* home. I’ve been talking to this couple for a while, so we gave my sellers a really long closing date that they could shorten up at any time. And sure enough, **they were able to use that secure sale to get into their next house more easily.** They they were able to wrap up our sale more quickly than they had expected.

On the buying side, we have a lot of buyers who are being asked to waive inspections, waive financing, waive their title contingency (most people don’t even know what a title contingency is or why they would even want to waive it; I *do* know what it is, and I *still* don’t know why anyone would want to waive that). But the bottom line is that **not every buyer is ready to jump in, throw caution to the wind and throw everything into just getting a house.** Because something bad might happen down the road, and that’s why we have those contingencies.

So I’ve got another buyer who’s buying a house that’s a little more out of the way. They’re working with the seller to be able to get repairs needed so they can be financed; **it’s just a matter of talking, having good relationships with the local Realtors, and making sure that everyone is able to get their clients through a transaction** at the pace that they need with the safeties they need. Sellers need to know that they have a paycheck at the end of it, and buyers need to a home that they can move into and know that there’s not going to be any big catastrophic surprises down the road. 

Moving is really hard work, and buying or selling a home can be really stressful. Give me a call. Even if it's not right now but it’s coming up in a few months, let’s make a plan so that we can take the fear out and put the joy in. Have a beautiful day, stay safe, and call me when there’s something I can do to help you with your home\!
