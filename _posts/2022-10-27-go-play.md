Hey, this is Sandy, and I'm just going to take a minute while I am waiting for my turn at the tee box. I am going to say what a gorgeous day this is, and I hope you are able to take some time to enjoy our Pacific Northwest.&nbsp;

**We have so many beautiful opportunities to enjoy,** whether it's hiking or golfing, which is my version of hiking. Pretty, pretty flower gardens. I don't know if you can see them from here, but what a beautiful part of the country we live in. So take some time. Get out in the sunshine before it ends, before it gets overcast and rainy; and if you'd like to do it with others, great. I'm actually really enjoying this time alone today.

This was Don's and my anniversary course. We come down and stay in Neahkahnie&nbsp; beach, and come play at Manzanita Links, and it is just beautiful, gorgeous, cozy and a pleasure. So I am so thoroughly enjoying this opportunity today to relive great memoriesâ€”actually having a decent game of golf and just thanking the Lord for the beautiful place that He put me in and where I get to live.

So I hope that you are blessed. Stay blessed, be healthy, and rejoice in the beautiful opportunities that we have. Have a super day\!
