Here’s why an off-market home transaction might make sense for you.

Let me tell you about the not-so-new trend of checking out your neighbor’s house. You like it? Make an offer. Let me tell you how we can help you with that.

**We are currently helping two different sellers who never listed their house in the local multiple listing service.** Why did they do that? They were approached by someone who wanted to buy and knew they wanted to sell, and they asked us to help them through that process.&nbsp;

You see, we help our clients fulfill their best interests as they see them. So what’s the downside to not putting it on the market? You don’t have the competition, so you may be taking less than you would get if you were to put it on the open market. What’s the benefit?&nbsp;

There are several. One of them is stability.The sellers may want to go ahead and secure the buyer now but stretch out the purchase to meet other family timelines. And if it all goes sidewise, the sellers can go ahead and list their house on the open market without any of the buyers looking at them sideways because it didn’t go well the first time for whatever reason.

If you need a home and you hear of someone who is looking to sell, call me. **I can help you avoid that stiff buyer competition** and get the home for you at a price that makes the seller glad to sell it to you now. Or if you have a home to sell and your neighbor’s cousin wants to make it theirs,I can help you protect your interests and sell it for a price that makes you smile all the way to the bank.

Thanks for listening today. Stay safe, stay healthy, and call me when I can help you and the ones you care about move in and out of their homes. Have a great day.
