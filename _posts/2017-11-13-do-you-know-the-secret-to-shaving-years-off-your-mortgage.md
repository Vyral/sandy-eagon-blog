Today, I’ve got one easy way you can pay your mortgage off sooner and ultimately for less money.

If you’re an American today, you’ve likely got a housing payment. This is true whether you rent or you own a home.

The tip I have today can help regardless of where you’re trying to go, whether that is a paid-off mortgage or car, or getting to homeownership in general. Before I tell you what this tip is, understand that it’s a lot easier than it sounds.

**I recommend paying slightly more than you currently are.** If this doesn't sound like saving money, let me explain.

At the beginning of this year, I decided I wanted to be at a certain point in my mortgage at the end of the year.

So I found what I was paying in principal only each month, and where that would naturally put my mortgage balance by the end of the year.

Then I **subtracted my goal number from the number it would be without any different payment. I divided that difference by 12 (for each month).** That number plus my regular payment was doable for me. If you are looking for wealth, use this tip.

How much of a difference did this actually make? Well, using a loan term calculator that you can find [here](http://www.free-online-calculator-use.com/missing-term-loan-calculator.html#calculator), I did some math. It turns out that I’m shaving 14 years off my mortgage. **Additionally, I’ll save about $90,000  in interest that I won’t have to pay.**

Many of us are guilty of simply seeing a number on our statement and just paying that particular amount. But this doesn’t have to be your strategy. Imagine all that you could be saving by using this simple tip. You can implement this incrementally, as well.

Even if you pay just $50 extra per month on your mortgage, you would still be shaving time and money off your mortgage payments.

**These tips can help even if you aren’t currently paying a mortgage.** Let’s say you’re making car payments right now. Use the calculator to see how a little higher payment each month can make a big difference to your bottom line. This can apply to any payment plan you're on.

Now remember, if you need to take care of other areas of your finances before you can implement this strategy, visit [www.DaveRamsey.com.](https://www.daveramsey.com/)

Be a great steward of your resources. What you have is what you've been given to take care of.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

And of course, if you are looking to sell or to buy a home in the next few months, we can help you with that.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.
