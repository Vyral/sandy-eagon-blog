What’s happening in the spring 2025 marke in Snohomish & King Countiest? If you’re a buyer, you may feel like the options are limited, but you have more homes for sale now than you did a year ago. So, count yourself blessed. But what does that mean for buyers, sellers, and our local real estate market? Here’s what you need to know:

**What’s happening in Snohomish County?** We have 17% more homes available this year than last year. However, even though we have 17% more homes available now, we only have 4% more homes pending or in process, and only 2.8% more sales than we did last year.

Sellers need to be at their best to ensure their home stands out in the market. It’s a creative environment where both buyers and sellers must be proactive. Everyone should be ready to put in the effort to sell their house successfully.

*Where are home prices in Snohomish County right now?* This year, our median home prices are 3% higher than they were last spring. Despite higher interest rates, we saw significant growth in prices and values. Recently, that growth has quieted down, but we’re still seeing a 3% increase in value compared to last year.

**What’s happening in King County?** You might be surprised by this: King County has 20% more homes available and 12% more pending sales, but only 1% more closed sales. This suggests that deals are falling through more often in King County compared to Snohomish County.

Like in Snohomish County, King County sellers must be proactive and work hard to ensure their transactions succeed.

*Where are home prices in King County right now?* Overall, prices are less than 1% higher this year than last year. This means the market has remained stable: we haven’t lost much but haven’t gained much.

**What does this mean for you?** Depending on your location, if you’re a buyer, you need to get your ducks in a row: be well-prepared and ensure everything is in order.

And if you’re a seller, that means you’ll have to pay close attention to recent sales in your area because you can’t overshoot the market right now. Homebuyers are not able or willing to take a chance on inflated prices. If they feel the price is too steep, they’re going to wait for a better option; they’re not willing to do just anything to get a house anywhere.

**What does this mean for real estate?** It means we step in to help make things happen. I was at the courthouse for four hours last week with one of my clients, handling the legalities of making sure that all the title issues were in order. I’ve been sending my people to insurance companies, attorneys, and lenders. We’re making sure that we use all of our resources and connections to help you complete your solid home transaction.
