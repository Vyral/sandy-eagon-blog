<p style="text-align: center;"><em>No matter which of the two trends describes your needs, we’re here to help.</em></p>

Whether you’re staying home because of safety reasons or because of work reasons (working from home), or whether you’re looking for a different place to live because your family is changing, or your work is changing and it’s time to follow through, you are in good company.&nbsp;

Right now, we’re seeing that people are either staying in their homes and fixing them up, or we’re also seeing a big chunk of people who are changing states (not necessarily full states). I actually have a client going to Spokane, I’ve got another one going to Idaho, and a third client considering the move to Idaho, so there are many miles between this house and the next one.&nbsp;

**If you’re looking to make a change and there are many miles in between, I can help you with that.** I can help you with your house here, and let you know what you need to do in order to get maximum value in this very unique time in our housing history. I can also help you find a fabulous Realtor to get your needs met at the next home as well.&nbsp;

Call me; let’s have a conversation about what’s going on in your life and how we can best help. Have an amazing day, and be blessed in your home—this one, and the one to come\! I’ll talk to you soon\!
