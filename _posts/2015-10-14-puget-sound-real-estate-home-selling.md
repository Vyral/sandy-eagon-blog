We have a lot of professionals who ask us about handling short sale situations, particularly when their clients are in distress mode and need to sell.

For example, a couple of years ago, an agent wanted to partner with us in selling their client's house because we could negotiate the short sale. It was a long road for that client.

Last February, we made it all the way to closing, but the buyer never sent in their money. That meant we had to relist the home. We got another offer fairly quickly. We were told that this buyer was making a cash offer, but then we got a call from a lender asking for certain documentation before they would send us the money.

A lot of people wanted to fire the buyer. We had to deal with the escrow people, the mortgage holders, and the lender. However, this seller deserved a close. As the professionals, we wanted to do everything in our power to make this closing happen. We were able to get everybody on board, and we had a closing right on time!

So here's my question to you: Who do you know right now who is looking for a real estate professional who will make a sale happen for them? Whether they have equity on the home or not, we will work every angle to get that job done. Give us a call or send us an email. We would love to guide you!
