Today, we're talking about walking out our purpose. I want to work on dealing with my emotions in a way that practices my faith. Our emotions affect so much of what happens in our day and how we treat other people.

I'd like to share a conversation I had with my coach, Chris, about how to get to that next level. Here's what I took back.

"There's a teaching that says, 'We can't control the first thought, but we can control the second thought, and the third.' It's like putting yourself on a mental diet. You have to ask, 'Do I really want to allow those negative thoughts?'

"You have to exercise your faith muscle. There are all kinds of levels of [physical] fitness, and for some people, just being able to move more in a general, active way is more fit than they were, especially for people overcoming health issues. Just being able to be mobile is huge, so how can we judge ourselves based on one person to the other?"

You can listen to the full conversation [here](https://soundcloud.com/sandy-eagon/sandy-eagon-on-emotional-rollercoasters). I would love to hear your thoughts. If there's anything you can share or learn from each other to get us out of that rut of how we've always worked, please reach out to me. Let's be purposeful in our lives and be that person we're meant and created to be. I look forward to hearing from you!
