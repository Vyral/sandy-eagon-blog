<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Today we are talking about Sandy’s toolshed.</em></p>

This message is just a reminder that I help my clients and our community whether or not you’re buying or selling a house. One of the ways I do that is with my toolshed. In my shed, we have a carpet cleaner, power washer, trimmer, and a fruit-picker. All you have to do is come on over\! If you need a tool for your home maintenance needs, let me know; I’d be happy to help you. To see my telescoping tree-trimmer in action, watch this short video.
