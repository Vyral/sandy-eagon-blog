If you’re a scared homeowner, I’m here to help you today. Last month, I knocked at a house in Marysville where the lights were on inside, a young child looked out the window, but no adult came to the door.

 I put my letter to the homeowner in the screen, but I'd forgotten to include the page of value statistics that my letter referenced. **I looked up their name in the tax records so I could mail it to them, and when I did that, I saw they had a foreclosure auction scheduled.**

I then realized that the homeowner had been hiding from me, and that made me sad. I know that feeling when you have a foreclosure auction scheduled and things are all wrong and you don’t know how to make them right. I hate it. However, you need to know what to do next if you ever find yourself in that situation. Just because we don’t see as many foreclosed properties as we used to doesn’t mean they aren’t still happening.

**If you are behind on your payments, you’re in a bind, or you don’t know what to do next, I can help.** It might mean helping you sell your house. It might mean helping you refinance. We have to talk now while you have the greatest number of options available.

If you have any questions for me in the meantime, reach out. Call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
