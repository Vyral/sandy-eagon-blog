<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Thank you to every single one of you for playing a part in our success.</em></p>

I just wanted to take time today to thank you all so much for the part that you play in our success. We have had a wonderful year helping people buy and sell their homes and their investments, and **we couldn’t do it without all of you—every single one of you.**

We understand that this is a team effort, whether you’re our client and you’re putting your trust in us to put our expertise to work for you or you’re one of our trusted partners—title, escrow, lenders, contractors, or inspectors.

Our team is full of amazing people with amazing talent. We get to help people, just like many of you, get into the home of your dreams, your first home together, or that retirement home that finally has no more stairs and an amazing flower garden.

Thank you so much from the bottom of our hearts. You have made our job not just a job, but truly a passion and a calling. We are so grateful—Harley and I both.

**Have an amazing Thanksgiving\!** I hope you are surrounded by the people you love and who love you in return. Take care, and I’m excited to help you and talk with you soon.
