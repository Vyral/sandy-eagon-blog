Today I'm speaking with my coach about what we do when we are waiting for our prayers to be answered.

When something is going really wrong in your life, what do you do in the meantime? Do you pray? Do you think things over in your head?

It keeps coming back to the seeds that I plant in my life. Do you cultivate joy? Do you do the things necessary to give you peace?
{% include pullquote.html %}
When I get upset I work to remind myself what I need to do in order to restore my peace. In the downtime between something bad and something good, it's important to remember what you need to do to make yourself better while you're waiting for your prayers to be answered.

When you can do these things, you are more able to handle the tough things that happen in your life.

Thanks for watching, and I hope everyone gets something good out of this conversation!
