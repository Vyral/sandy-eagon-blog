Thanksgiving is here\! I hope you are as excited as I am.

**I’d like to take a moment to express my gratitude to all of you this Thanksgiving.**&nbsp;We've had a wonderful year with wonderful people who have made me laugh and love. I wouldn’t be where I am today without all of your support, and we are grateful.

Please enjoy my Thanksgiving encouragement video, complete with a significant guest appearance by Harley.

And then enjoy your Thanksgiving dinner—that’s what we plan to do\!

Then as soon as the leftovers are put away and the stock is ready for turkey noodle soup, we'll be back in the office and ready to serve you again.

Please watch to hear how we're grateful for you this Thanksgiving season.&nbsp;
