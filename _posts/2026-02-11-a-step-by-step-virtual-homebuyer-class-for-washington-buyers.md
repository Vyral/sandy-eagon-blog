We have some exciting news!

Howard and I are going to be running some first-time homebuyer classes, not necessarily just for first-timers, but also for anyone who needs a refresher on how home buying works.

On February 18 and 19, that's Wednesday and Thursday night, we're going to be doing a 2.5-hour Zoom session, and we'll tell you all about what it takes to purchase a home.

These classes also **qualify for the Washington State Housing Finance Commission credit.** If you're planning to use a state bond loan, you will need to take this homebuyer class.

This will enable you to access a zero-down loan, allowing you to purchase anywhere in Washington State. It's a pretty nifty program.

Whether or not I’m your agent, and whether or not Howard is your lender, we can help you with that class, provide more information, and get you on your merry way.

If you’re not already under contract and want to learn more, message me, call me, or text me. Let's get you on the schedule for that.

I want to share everything about home buying so that you know **our goal is to help everyone get into homes.** This way, you can start putting your money where your home is, not where your landlord's is.

I’m super excited to see you there. Again, here are the details for the buyer seminar:

**First-Time Buyer Seminar<br>Dates:** February 18 and February 19<br>**Time:** 5:30 p.m. to 8:00 p.m.<br>**Format:** Live Zoom class

Let me know if you’d like to join us. And if you already own a home or know someone who would benefit from a class like this, feel free to pass it along.

If you have any questions about this event or any other real estate matters, message, call, or text me at [**(425) 422-7372**](tel:4254227372){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} or [**Sandy@SandyAndCompany.com**](mailto:Sandy@SandyAndCompany.com){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

Have a super blessed day. Stay safe, stay healthy, and we’re excited to assist you and your people with their home needs.
