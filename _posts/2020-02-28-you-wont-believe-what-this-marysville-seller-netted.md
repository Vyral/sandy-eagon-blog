We are doing absolutely top-notch things for all of our clients here in today’s market, and here’s a story to prove it.

It’s a crazy market out there. We’ve helped one of my clients with a couple of different houses, so we when we sat down to talk about selling her house up here in the north end of Marysville, we took a look at what had been for sale and we chose a price right between the last two sales in the market.&nbsp;

When we decided to list for $395,000, we knew that it would probably go up a little bit because there are so many people looking for houses for sale—it’ll probably go up into $400,000 or $410,000, maybe even $415,000 if we’re doing really well.&nbsp;

What we did not realize is that **we would get 18 offers that drove us up to $440,000 for this almost 1,600-square foot rambler in Marysville.** When it appraised for $440,000, we were absolutely thrilled. Carrie was looking at the master statement—which we always do, we always make sure all of the numbers are correct before the seller signs—and she had a huge A-ha\! moment. **Our seller netted more than what she listed the house for.**

She was perfectly content to get $395,000 if that was the right price for the market, and so, in a way, we kind of just sold her house for free—not quite, of course; she still did go ahead and pay all of her costs, but after she paid everything, she actually netted more than she had her house for sale.&nbsp;

Can I do that for you next time? I am not going to promise that—I don’t guarantee a thing except that we will get you the absolute best possible price in today’s market with today’s buyers. **It is an amazing time for sellers right now; it is also an amazing time for buyers.** In the same week that we got 18 offers for our seller, we got four of our buyers’ houses closed and we were able to hand out keys for their new homes.&nbsp;

So whether you’re a buyer or a seller, give us a call; we are doing absolutely top-notch things for all of our clients here in today’s market. Have an amazing day, and make it a blessed one\! I’m excited to talk with you when you are ready to change your home.
