<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here’s why the holidays are best served with a side of mindful priorities.</em></p>

Yesterday I had an agent call, as they often do when we put a new house on the market for sale, and ask, “What is most important to your seller?” As they’re crafting an offer, they want to know what they can do to make their offer acceptable to my seller.

It’s not an unusual question. We actually ask that question right away when we sit down with new clients, whether they’re sellers, it’s going to be one of about three things that are most important, and if it’s a buyer it can be one of many. We have to make sure that we’re acting in order of what is important to them.

As we move into the season, it’s fraught with distraction all around us. Thanksgiving has passed, and Christmas is around the corner, and there is so much grabbing our attention saying, “Pay attention to me\! Pay attention to me\!”&nbsp;

So as we move into this time that can be so incredible, we have to make sure and do it with priority; **what is most important?**

For me and my house, we will serve the Lord. I am so glad that I get to show love and service to my God by loving the people around me, being His hands and feet.&nbsp;

How do I know what’s most important to them? Guess what, I get to ask about that. I get to ask, “What is most important to you?” Whether it’s my clients, and I can find out how I can best serve them, or my family (“What do you need from me? Is it time? Is it a certain thing that I can help with? Is there something that I can help put together and be of active service?”)

My hope for you is that you are able to walk through this season and find the joy and the blessing from serving those around you, asking, “What is that priority?” Ask it of yourself first. What is most important for me to be doing today, and how can I get to the most important for later on?

If we can be of any service to that, please be sure to let me know. If there’s a priority about your home that has to change, **we are so glad to be your trusted resource** and advice, letting you know what you can look at and how we can help. Have a blessed day. Stay healthy, stay blessed, and when your real estate needs change, please call us, email us, message. We’re here to help.
