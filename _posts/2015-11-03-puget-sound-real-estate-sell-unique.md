Recently, we sold a pretty unique property for a seller of ours, and today we're talking about what we did to sell that home quickly and for top dollar. I got a call this summer from a colleague in the lending field who was ready to sell his home.

They had 5 acres, complete with a huge shop, apartment, barn, and private lakefront in a quiet area of Arlington. It was an awesome property, and there were quite a few agents competing for their listing. I put my best foot forward, told them I would earn their business, and showed them how. When they trusted me to list their home, we put together a game plan to make it happen.

The first part of the plan was marketing. We posted the listing on all of the online portals we usually do, with the addition of some specific sites where we knew the horse owners would be looking.

Since we know 70% of homes get sold through the local MLS, we had to make sure the agents out there knew exactly all we had here. We invited them to an open house for brokers, where we toured them through the great big shop and barn on the property.

We had four strong buyer candidates in just the first weekend. None of them needed everything, so one by one the buyers started pulling out. But we knew the value was there. We continued marketing the property and each week we added another piece to get some extra exposure.

Sure enough, we had a buyer come in from out of town who was looking for a lakefront property. They came out and looked, and we started negotiating from there. Then another buyer who had looked and been asking questions offered, and we ended up getting 2 full-price offers for the home. Ultimately, we sold it to the out of town buyer, and ended up delivering a nice profit check to our sellers.

If you are looking for someone to sell your home who takes the time to understand your unique situation and use it to your advantage when marketing the property, we would love to sit down with you and talk about how we can get you the most amount of money in your pocket today.

If you have any questions for us, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you!
