There are a couple of great ways that you can be a hero around the Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner table.

When I talk with my clients and friends about how we can help their family and friends with their home purchase or sale, I often hear something like, “My sister would be a great person you could help.” Other times, I hear something like, “Well, my cousin Bob needs help, but you don’t want to work with him.”

We may be able to help your cousin Bob and **make you a hero by being his real estate resource.**

Some of our family and friends can be hard to please. Let me decide who I can best work with.

Since I work with them in a professional setting, I can be professional and let them know, “This is what I can do for you.” That helps them see what can happen and how we can get them there.

It doesn’t always mean that it’s going to be peaches and cream or that I’m going to be sitting around eating pizza with them on a Seahawks game day. However, I can keep this transaction professional and still make them feel good since we were able to get their house sold.

The first way you can be a hero is to tell your friend or relative, “You should talk to Sandy. She has helped a lot of people over the last 14 years and she has  great ideas to help you.”

The second is to tell them, “I’m going to have Sandy call you. Sandy has helped so many people in our area over the last 14 years. She is an expert and a resource. She’s patient and she will help you get through this process and get your next home.”

**Whether they need help buying or selling a home, introduce them to me.** Let me decide whether they're too hard to work with. Usually I can set good professional boundaries. But if I can't help them, I’ll tell them up-front. I don’t want them to spend a ton of energy and heartache on something that we both know isn’t going to work out.

That said, nine times out of 10 I do help them. And most of the time, I end up liking them in the process.

So if you have a cranky cousin or needy friend and you’re not sure I'll love them, just give me a call. Those people need help too, and I would be honored with the introduction.

As always, if you have any other questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you!
