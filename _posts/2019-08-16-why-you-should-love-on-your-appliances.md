I’m doing a little Saturday cleaning this morning. It’s raining and one of those Saturdays where you know it’s time to pay attention to the house.&nbsp;

When I washed the floor and bumped off the guard on my fridge, I realized I hadn’t vacuumed under there for a very long time. **I’ve been told that when you vacuum the coils of your fridge, you extend the life of its motor for years.**&nbsp;

It was disgusting. There was dirt and food left over from what had been kicked underneath. Once I got down there, I vacuumed under the fridge and I could practically hear it say “Thank you\!” **It’s breathing better, it’s working better, and I’m going to be able to have my fridge that I like a lot for quite some time.**

I decided that since I was already down there, I would go do the oven. I took the drawer out from underneath it and did the same thing. For most of our ovens, you can just take that bottom drawer out, vacuum underneath, and that’s just part of honoring what you have—being good stewards.

**Our motto is “Making lives better.”** Part of that is helping you live in your home for a longer time and feel better about it. Have you loved your appliances lately? Grab a vacuum, grab a rag. These little things make them and you love each other for a longer time.

If you want to be in a home that makes you excited to clean those spots under the fridge and stove, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
