The newest addition to Sandy and Company has been a match made in heaven.

Hey there\! It’s Sandy with Sandy and Company, and today I'm so excited I get to introduce Sarah Green.&nbsp;

I first met with Sarah about becoming an agent about a year ago. I helped Sarah through that—just figuring out what she wanted to do—and yes, she became an agent, and then started mentoring her when she got her license at the end of July. **What I was impressed with for Sarah is that I felt like she was smart.** I keep leading with that, but it’s so important to have somebody who can understand the situation that they’re in because our business is so technical and has so much liability that you’d better be ready to know how to take care of your clients and really safeguard them. That is our No. 1 job.&nbsp;

And then we started using Sarah to show houses when I couldn’t be in other places, when Carrie couldn’t be in other places, and finally realized at the end of the year that we wanted to join forces. **I’m so excited we’ve got Sarah with us full-time,** and I’m going to turn this over to her for a couple minutes, and I’d just love to hear what she’s excited about coming up and what she’s been seeing and what she feels like she’s been adding here.&nbsp;

“I’m excited,” Sarah says. “You know, I’ve got a one-and-a-half-year-old crazy son at home, so I’ve got a young family. And I have a great, supportive family as well, so it gives me a lot of flexibility to be with him, but also at the same time to be helping our clients. Right now I’ve got a buyer, Nick, who’s been great fun to work with. And the way the market is right now, you really have to look at the person, see what works best for them, and at the same time put together a strong offer specific to the house we’re looking at.

“We could be looking at a home on acreage in Arlington, and the offer on that could be completely different than the home in Marysville that we’re putting an offer on. It’s a lot of thought, a lot of back and forth and stuff and what works best for them and everything else. It’s fun. It’s a challenge, but I enjoy it.”

We have a lot of right hands here. I’ve got Carrie in the office, and we’ve got Sarah here out with buyers and with sellers too. She meets up with our sellers because we were actually just finishing up a virtual open house, and then when we have buyers who are interested, she’s familiar with the product so she can make sure whether this is a good fit for them. And again, everyone is taken care of. That’s kind of our theme here.&nbsp;

Congratulations to Sarah and welcome\! We’re so psyched to have her with us. It’s been a little bit of a process for introducing her and I just want to make sure everybody understands that Sandy and Company really means “and company” or “and team” because we’re all working together for the same end, which is taking care of our people. As we like to remind you, our motto on our team is “making lives better,” and Sarah definitely does that for all of us, and does that for our clients as well, and I like that fact that we’re making her life better too.

“I’m more excited also for the experience,” Sarah adds. “You know, to have Sandy here with me, guiding me. It’s a whole new venture for me, so I feel very lucky to have this mentor, this person guiding me to really kind of help me out along the way.”

Well perfect\! **It’s a match made in heaven, and we’re very glad to be together.** We’re excited to help you, so if there’s anything we can do for you, for your home, whether it doesn’t fit anymore or whether there’s something you need to change to make it fit, let’s talk. Have an amazing day, stay blessed, stay healthy, and we’re looking forward to talking with you soon about your home.
