Why should buyers and sellers consider getting out in the market right now? A lot of people are wondering what to do right now with the way the market, finances, and the world feel uncertain.

If you’ve been thinking of making a move, this might surprise you: winter can bring opportunities for both buyers and sellers that just don’t exist in spring or summer.

So let’s break down what’s really happening this season, and how it could work in your favor.

**Opportunities for homebuyers.** First, there’s less competition in the winter, which means you may be able to secure a better deal.

Currently, there are twice as many homes available compared to this time last year, but about half as many buyers. This creates opportunities for you to find the right house at the right value, and potentially receive assistance with your closing costs or purchase with a lower or no down payment, depending on your financial situation.

**Opportunities for both a seller and a buyer.** One of the biggest advantages is that it allows you to secure the right house for your next life stage. If you already own a home, there’s no need to rush; you’re not desperate. Instead, you can be proactive in exploring what your next step should be.

If you know you want to transition to a no-stairs home next year, it's wise to start looking at options now. Winter might be the ideal time to find that perfect home for your next chapter.

**Opportunities for sellers.** You’ll encounter less competition from other sellers during this time of year. Even if you have a great house, it may not have a standout feature to differentiate it from the other ten similar homes in the area.

This is an excellent opportunity to say, "Hey, look at mine!" with fewer houses competing for attention.

**Winter brings more serious buyers.** As people aren't trudging through homes in the rain and cold just for something to do on a Saturday afternoon. They'd rather be cozy at home with a cup of tea, working on a project or watching a game. Selling your home in the fall could attract buyers who are serious and ready to make a deal, allowing you to sell your house without the hassle.

**Family timing is crucial.** Life events often prompt changes in your living situation. If you're facing challenges at home, we are here to help. We are currently assisting a family in Monroe whose father has gone into the hospital and won't be able to return home. They needed to act quickly to ensure he has the resources he needs and to alleviate his worries about the house while he's away.

We stepped in to help, and we are here for you, rain or shine, snow or sleet. We may not be the post office, but we are close. We're glad to support you through all seasons and in whatever way is helpful for your home.
