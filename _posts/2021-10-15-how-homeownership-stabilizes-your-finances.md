This is a friend-of-a-friend story today. One of the big questions we have right now is: With all the uncertainty, are we going to have enough money to make it in the future? A friend called me a few weeks ago, and she was concerned for her friend who was in her 50s and still renting an apartment. We’ll call her Faith.&nbsp;

My friend had been talking to Faith for a while now about buying a condo in order to stabilize her living expenses. Faith works at Walmart, an hourly job, but she has also just gotten a nice little inheritance. So if she bought a condo, **she could go ahead and pay for that condo with her inheritance**, have enough money for security, and let her hourly job pay for her living expenses and homeowners association fees, especially once she no longer paid over $1,000 a month for rent.

So finally, **Faith was ready to take that leap.** We found her a nice little condo in town and made sure she had an inspection so that she can get her family in there and make sure that we had the thumbs up from everyone that she was going to be well taken care of. I just gave her the keys last weekend, and she is so excited. She is thrilled that she gets to make this her own place that feels so good and feels pretty around her. And our mutual friend is relieved Faith is no longer paying rent to a landlord who can charge whatever he likes because he can, and that’s what the market will bear.&nbsp;
