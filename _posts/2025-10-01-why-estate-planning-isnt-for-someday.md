We talked with two families just this week whose parents didn’t have a will or a power of attorney. Both parents are in the hospital, and their families are scrambling to get legal authority to handle the parents’ bills, house, and other property.

We can’t stress this enough! Powers of attorney and wills are documents that are vital if you have anything of value: house, assets, and especially under-age children. These are how you make sure that you determine what happens to what’s important to you- not left to others to figure out in a difficult and emotional time.

We’ve seen good families split apart at the seams from arguing over the house, its contents and how to handle a sale. We’ve heard others make siblings swear that they’ll provide a home for their children and not let them go to So-and-so. And medical directives too: we’ve watched friends agonize over what extent of medical treatment their parents would want and they should authorize.

A will is you telling others what “will” happen. Let it be what you want instead of what others decide for you. For your finances, your health, your children.

Do you know a good estate attorney? We know a few good ones and could refer one to you. Is it an expense? Of course, but it’s more important than saving for your next home upgrade or vacation. And probably much cheaper too.

When you’re ready to sell the family house, we’ll be here for you then, too. In the meantime, please do what you can to make the hard decisions easier for those you love and put it in writing.

Have a blessed day and call us when we can help with your real estate needs!
