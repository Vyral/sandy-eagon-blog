Today I want to show you a brief snippet of a longer interview that I did with Pastor Chris Manginelli. You can find the full interview here.

A lot of us want instantaneous gratification, and God doesn't always grant that. He rewards those who diligently seek him. You have to learn how to hear him and how to respond to him. To those who sincerely seek him, you will find him.

Even when life gets tough and dark, remember that life is seasonal and that God is always there for us. If you persevere, you will find God.

Once again, if you'd like to hear the full interview, you can listen to it here.

I hope that you find value in this. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me!
