Hey there, it’s Sandy with Sandy & Company, and today we are talking to our buyers, and I'm asking you, why wait? I can't tell you how many times I hear people say, “It is just not the right time to buy.” And I want to ask (and sometimes I do if I'm in the right spot with them) “Why do you say that?”

If you are waiting, as a buyer, for something to change before you go ahead and put an offer on a house or talk to your lender, then you need to understand—something did just change. With our new year, what we're seeing is that more buyers are out here right now because there is more confidence. What happened to make that difference?

**Prices have come down, interest rates have stabilized**, and sellers are giving an average of 5% off of what they've already landed at after they've dropped the price enough for you to even make an offer in the first place. They are accepting lower offers and giving closing costs to make you better able to buy their house.

Fear often makes us freeze, and I don't want you to freeze. I want you to take a look at the situation right now and say, “There's something that I can do because it's changing, and it's changing for the better.” If you haven't done anything at all, talk to your lender. If you don't have one, ask me. I have several amazing lenders that will absolutely sit with you and take care of your needs at whatever point in the process you are.

If you have already talked with your lender, **make sure everything's up to date for approval** with today's rates in today's terms. If you're already approved, let's go take a look at a house and see what that looks like in your price range with a payment that you're comfortable. If you're not even sure where to start, give me a call or message me.&nbsp;

Sarah is putting together a homebuyers class for this spring. If you can't wait that long, then let's just sit down and talk and say this is what you need to take a look at and this is how you need to prepare. What is next? Take a first step. A long journey begins with a single step, we all know that. Don't be frozen. Be strong, and take that first step to get you into your own home.

**Stop paying your landlord's mortgage.** That's what I want to tell you first of all. Make that step to get into your first home or get into the home that better fits you. Contingent offers are being looked at as well, and buyers have much more of a balanced opportunity than they’ve had for the last five or six years.

Now is the time. The tide has changed, and it is in your favor. Open up and see all of the opportunity that has always been there, but now it's open because the tide's out and ready for you. Let's make this happen one step at a time.&nbsp;

Have a super blessed day. Stay safe. Stay healthy. Talk with me about your home needs. We're glad to be here and to make your life better. Be blessed.
