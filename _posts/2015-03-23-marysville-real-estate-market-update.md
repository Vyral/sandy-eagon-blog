In order to prepare you for a successful spring real estate transaction, I'd like to share some information with you in the hopes that you can use it to your own advantage when you enter the real estate market.


* Home prices are rising slightly because of increased competition from spring home buyers.
* There is only a month and a half of inventory, and this is driving up prices as well.
* Home prices should soften up after the spring when there is less competition.
* With low interest rates, (sitting right around 3.75%) more buyers will be able to afford homes, and sellers will also reap the benefits of this increased affordability.
