Today we are talking about what’s most important and how we stay on track. We generally have great ideas—something that we know is going to push us into the next area, whether it’s with family, or investment, or our health. Life comes along and motivations change, and the next thing we know we’re moving onto the next thing. Looking back along the years, unless we really have a way to track what we’re working on and we’re working toward, often we have very little to show for it. **That’s why the experts say, “Write it down.”** What is written for you?

We went on a vacation a few weeks ago to check out whether Desert Aire is a good long-term vacation place for us and a good investment area. **My motivation kept changing through each part of the trip.** Getting ready, I was wondering whether the drive would be too long for us to go for weekends. When I was there, though, I was all for it. I was totally able to unplug and be present with family. Then on the drive back, I was already starting to think about things I needed to do (and the trip was extra long because of traffic). I was not really sure by the end of it whether that was the place for us to invest.

**It made me realize that if I don’t have a focused goal, I’m not going to get a whole lot done.** The experts tell us to write it down and make what they call “SMART goals.” Things that are important get written down. In our business, our contracts are always written and even our to-do lists get written down and crossed off. SMART stands for Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-Bound.&nbsp;

In the next three months, we’re going to have another short-term vacation. **I’m not sure whether it’s going to be back at Desert Aire, but we’re going to keep pushing** to find out where the right place is for both our investment and a great way to relax and unplug.

**How can I help you with your goals?** If you are looking to buy a house, let’s talk right now about what we can do. Whether you’ve got some work to do or whether you’re ready to go right now, let’s talk about how to make that happen. If you’re looking to sell your house and find the next one, let’s talk about what steps you need to take right now so that you’re ready to make that smart move for you and your family.
