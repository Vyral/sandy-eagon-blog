As the summer starts to heat up, our Pacific Northwest real estate market cools down just a bit. After all, the sun is shining and we natives know we have to take full advantage before it goes away again. Fortunately for our buyers, summer is a great opportunity and this year’s is no different 🙌🏼

Rates are still in the 7’s and prices are continuing to inch higher. How is that an opportunity?

I’m glad you asked 🤓

Even the conservative real estate experts are expecting rates to be back to the 6’s by the end of the year, and settling in the 5’s/6’s next year. Snohomish County alone has a conservative 20,000 buyers waiting and watching for the ball to drop before getting back into the game (I overheard the numbers 20,000-25,000 today). When even a fraction of those 20,000 buyers step back into making offers, how will the buyers compete the best?

Yes, you guessed it: price 🏷️

So buyers who are looking for a seller who will work with them have a perfect opportunity this summer when we have fewer active buyers. Need your closing costs paid? Using a down payment assistance program? Looking for a hungry seller who’s excited to see an offer at (only) asking price? More than any time in the last 5 years, this summer is your opportunity.

Yes, Sarah and I will be taking time with family and friends and doing a little vacationing over this summer ☀️ But between the two of us, we will always have boots on the ground for you.

If you’re hoping to get new keys this year or know someone who is, call us, text us, message us: let us share how we can help you take advantage of this summer lull and find your own home sweet home 🏡

Cheers!

**Sandy and Sarah**
