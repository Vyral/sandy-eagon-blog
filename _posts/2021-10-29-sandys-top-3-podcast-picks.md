Hi, this is Sandy with Sandy and Company and today we are talking about your greatest investment: yourself.

Did you know that the law of entropy applies to yourself as well? Everything moves from order to chaos. Everything, including your thought life and your motivation to become and to stay the best of who God made you. You can charge ahead in your business life and in your home life and your personal and your school life, but unless you have someone else coming alongside to help you stay up the up at the top, you can slide pretty quickly down that hill that you have climbed every day.

In an interview in 2019, Warren Buffet said, “By far, the best investment you can make is in yourself.” There are so many ways to invest in yourself, whether you go into classes and seminars, if you read books, listen to podcasts, you do coaching or you get mentorship.

Lately my favorite is podcasts. When I'm in the car, for an hour or so, one of the best ways I can stay awake is to listen to podcasts and to actually keep my mind moving the entire time. And they’re usually growth minded. I’m gonna give you my three favorite podcasts right now.

**Here's my first favorite podcast:&nbsp;**[**TheBrianBuffiniShow.com**](https://www.thebrianbuffinishow.com/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}**.** I love The Brian Buffini Show because he is interviewing so many different people from different walks of life.

Whether they are athletes, authors, preachers, politicians. Sometimes he just talks about the books and what he got out of them. But ultimately they're looking at the mindsets, the motivations and the methodologies, it's way it's the way they put it of success. And it's always encouraging. And it's always giving me things I can think about, about how to either improve things or sometimes to pat myself on the back a little bit because I've already got that in place.

**My second favorite podcast is Graham Cooke's&nbsp;**[**BrilliantPerspectives.com**](https://brilliantperspectives.com/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}**.** Graham Cook has such a heart for the love of Jesus and the magnificence of who he is and who we are in him. And I'm always left with an understanding with a better understanding of how much God really loves me, how much potential I have in him and the steps that I can take to really reach into, feel and experience that love. God loves me so much. And he loves you that much, too. Anything that we can do to tap into that is just making life better all the way around.

**My last favorite podcast is Keep The Faith's&nbsp;**[**ContagiousInfluencers.com.**](http://contagiousinfluencers.com/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}&nbsp;David Sams interviews high profile people. Most of the ones I've listened to have been actors, musicians, and athletes, high profile people that really once you get to the story behind the story, and I'm sure there's even more behind that, but it just gives us an idea of how that person got through either life's difficulties or even life successes and how it impacted them, and helps me think as well about my path and the tough things that I've been through and the great things I've experienced and how I can impact other people as well and share those experiences so that I can share the wealth and share the contentment of a really great life, that's lived well. As you can tell, I love The Lord, and I love people, and I get encouragement from both of those.&nbsp;

And that's how I really keep my mind being fed, so that I'm not just sitting in my own thoughts and sitting in my own experiences, getting my head out of my own self and into other people's stories really helps me keeping on the right track. You can find all of these online, just on the regular internet, as well as any podcast app that you have on your phone. And I highly encourage you to take some time and listen as a way to increase your net worth. And don't be surprised if you see the other net worth rise up as well. If you do need to change your home, if it's time to sell, if it's time to buy, or it's time to invest. Give me a call. Message, call, text me today, email me today. We are your Realtor resource who is interested in adding to your bottom line. Stay safe, stay healthy, stay blessed. I'll see you on the flip side.
