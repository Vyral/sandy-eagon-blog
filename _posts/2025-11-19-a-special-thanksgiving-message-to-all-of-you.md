Hey there, my friends!

As we approach Thanksgiving this year, I started thinking about our kitchen table, and I’m coming to you from my kitchen table.

I want you to think about who will be around your table, whether it’s on Thanksgiving Day or in the days before and after. Our family is known for gathering at various times.

Think about those people: if you weren’t at their table, or if they weren’t at yours, it would truly be felt. We are so grateful for them because these are the very relationships for which we are living our lives.

I want to express my gratitude to all of you for allowing us to care for you in your homes. Sarah and I are incredibly thankful for allowing us to take care of the people around our own tables. We are grateful that our lives have intertwined.

We’re able to provide help, service, and benefit to you, and at the same time, you offer help, service, and benefit to us. It’s a perfect relationship, and we appreciate it deeply.

This Thanksgiving, whether surrounded by all the people you wish to have at your table or noticing an empty chair, I encourage you to take a moment to express gratitude for what you have, for what you have experienced, and to look forward to the love, dreams, and joy that awaits you.

**Have a beautiful Thanksgiving!**
