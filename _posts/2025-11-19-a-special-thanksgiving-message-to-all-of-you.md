As we approach Thanksgiving this year, I find myself sitting at my kitchen table and reflecting on the past year.

I want you to think about who will be around your table, whether it’s on Thanksgiving Day itself, or a day before or after. Our family’s always been a little scattered, gathering at different times, but the point isn’t the date; it’s the people.

If they weren’t there, you’d feel it. You’d miss them. And that’s why you’re grateful for them. These are the people we’re really living for.

**Sarah and I want to say thank you for letting us care for you in your homes, whether you bought or sold a home with us this year.** Because in doing so, you’re also helping us care for the people at our own table. Our lives have become quietly, deeply intertwined in ways we never expected.

You give us the privilege of serving you, and in return, you give us purpose, connection, and gratitude. It’s not just business. It’s a beautiful, quiet reciprocity.

So this Thanksgiving, whether your table is full or you’re sitting with an empty chair, I hope you pause. Take a breath. Thank the people who are there. Remember the moments you cherished this year. And hold close the love, dreams, and joy still ahead.

Have a truly beautiful Thanksgiving. Thank you for everything you’ve brought into Sarah’s and my life this year.
