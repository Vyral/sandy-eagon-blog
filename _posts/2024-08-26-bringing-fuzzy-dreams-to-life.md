Hi Friends,

Just reaching out to share how we helped one of our long-time client friends get back on his feet.

During the 2010 down-turn, Daren lost his job and ultimately lost his house. That whole experience was super hard on him, and he’s spent the last ten years rebuilding.

Every couple years we’d talk and take a look at homes that he could get back into. He wasn’t looking for a palace. He’s very handy and loves the idea of earning sweat equity. But **each time he started hoping, work hiccupped or another financial impact slowed him down and his hopes were dashed.**

At the end of July, he reached out about a house that looked really good. I had Sarah step in to help. Unfortunately, that house was already pending- hope dashed again. But Sarah brought another to his attention that he hadn’t seen, so they took a look and made a good offer.

**For Sarah, it was her normal experience of helping someone who is ready and excited to buy their first (or first in a long time) home.** But for Daren, it was still just part of a fuzzy dream that he wasn’t sure could be reality. He was used to disappointment.

When Sarah called to tell him that the sellers accepted his offer, he was silent. She thought either it was a bad connection or that he was unhappy. But he stammered that he was just in shock and didn’t know what to say. 30 minutes later he texted saying again that he’d been in shock and was super excited.

Daren and the inspector brainstormed about the best way to add value, add another bathroom and open up the space. He is thrilled to get into his own home again. It truly is his palace, and he’ll have the keys at the end of this week.

Who’s the next person you know who would love to get their feet on solid home ground again? Whether they’re ready right now or unsure what could be possible**, we love helping our people take steps now so that ultimately their dream comes true.** Call, text or email us today so we can help them get one step closer to their own home sweet home.

Blessings,

**Sandy and Sarah**
