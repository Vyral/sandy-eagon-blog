        "content": "Today Iâm out at a new construction site with one of my buyers whoâs doing their inspection, and we had a great time.One of the things I really love about real estate is that I get to help each individual family in whatever story theyâre in right then.Â Two weeks ago, I listed a house. Then I held an open house for it on each of our snowy Saturdays. When I talked to a contractor who was working on the bathroom, he asked, âWhy would you hold an open house when most people canât get out here?â The answer is simple: Iâve been hired to do a job. And weâre going to do the best possible job for our clients every way we can. Weâve got great systems to help our clients on a regular basis so that when something is extenuating, like snow, weâre able to stretch out so that our clientsâ needs are met. Â I love my job. I love being able to let people know that I can help you through a process that can be really tricky and hairy.We can provide some sanity and peace and give you a home or a relief on the other end that really works for you.Â Thatâs what I love about real estate.Â If you know anyone whoâs thinking that houses are cool and they love people, Iâd love to talk with them. We have a couple of opportunities both on our team and in our office, and Iâd love to see if there would be a fit for them.âWe can provide some sanity and peace and give you something on the other end that really works for you.âIf youâre looking to buy a house, click the box to see all area homes. If youâre thinking of selling your home, click the box for your homeâs value.Thanks so much and have an amazing day! Letâs talk houses!",

        "content": "The truth is that the one-liners we see are not really the whole story. I have a tendency, like many others, to feel like my reality is wrapped up in this very moment. But when I slow down and wait for the story to unfold, oftentimes it just keeps getting better. I love that a lot.Last month, I had four buyers: Two offers got accepted, and two offers got turned down. The short story is that the market is already starting to pick up with that spring intensity that weâre expecting.âWhat we really need to be asking is, âWhat can we do for you today?ââAnd still thereâs another part of that story: This last week, the second two sellers came back to my buyers and said, âLetâs take another look at this.ââHowâs the market?â is too big a questionâtoo broad. What we really need to be asking is, âWhat can we do for you today?â And then we sit down, maybe grab a cup of tea, and then talk about where you are right now, what youâre looking for in your home, and how we can help you over the long run.Have an amazing day! We are so excited to talk with you about how we can help if youâre looking to buy or sell a home.",

        "category": "",
        "content": "With buying and selling real estate, there is so much going on. So how do we really narrow down whatâs most important? Thatâs what weâre talking about today.Christmastime that we just passed through is an excellent time to give us an example of how to keep it simple. Keep it simple, sweetie, right?What did we do with our family at Christmastime? We got to talk about Jesus, which is our favorite story to tell, we saw our family, whether they were coming to see us or we were going to see them, and Don and I also talked about whatâs most important for 2019 and what we can do to get there.Keep it simple and keep the top priority the top priority.Â In just the same way, I am working for my clients whether they are looking to sell their house or to buy.

So many of my clients over the past couple years have been concerned that they canât sell their current home because they wonât be able to find their next home. They need more bedrooms, more space, more room to park, etc. Theyâve been living in smaller homes that function okay for them but arenât really what they need for their family.Â âSellers are realizing that in order to get top dollar in this market, they need to be willing to allow buyers to sell their homes first.âHereâs the kicker, though: Last month I was searching for shop homes for my clientsâhomes with at least three- or four-car garagesâand I noticed that in the $400,000 to $500,000 price range, there were a lot of sellers that had accepted contingent offers. Sellers are realizing that in order to still get the price they want, they need to be willing to allow buyers to sell their homes first.Â So welcome back contingent offers!If you need to sell your current home before you can buy your best home, call me so we can make a plan. Then you can transition smoothly and seamlessly between homes.Â If you have any other questions about our market or you have any other real estate needs, feel free to reach out to me as well.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Buyers often assume they wonât need to have a Realtor on their side when buying new construction. After all, the agent working with the builders has all the information they could need, right?Actually, while this agent is usually very knowledgeable, itâs important to realize that they are not working specifically on your behalf. Having your own representation will help make sure you understand all the fine details of the process as they relate to you and your needs.Two of my clients are having their new home built in Monroe. Using the budget guidelines given during our initial meeting with the site agent, my clients went to the design studio and shopped for upgrades.Imagine their shock when the totals came back at $40,000 more than what they had budgeted and planned.I followed up quickly. As we found out during this next meeting, the site agent had explained the customization and upgrades in a way that sounded like we had $40,000 to spend in upgrades that were included in our agreed-on price. Not the case.At this point, it was up to my clients to decide what truly did matter to them. Because while they were happy with the standard finish options, certain customization options can have a significant impact on the livability of a new construction home. Â For example, current new construction doesnât include overhead lighting in dining rooms, living rooms, or bedrooms. These are the sort of details that buyers might not think to consider until theyâve been prompted. After all, most people wouldnât assume that overhead lighting would be an extra expense.âThe agents you will find at new construction homes are there to represent the buildersâ best interestsânot yours.âTo balance out those extra expenses, I pointed out several upgrades which were in the original plan but werenât necessary for my clients. A man door in the garage, for instance, turned out to be a $2,500 expense which my clients didnât even want.The gas BBQ stub (which would have added $600 to the cost of the home) and a railing instead of a stair wall (for $3,000) were two other features my clients easily eliminated.By cutting out even just these three features, my clients saved thousands below what the initial bundled cost had been.Thanks to this meeting, my clients walked away all smiles. When all was said and done, I helped them save just under $7,000. Â As you can see, customizing a new construction home can quickly rack up a high price tag. So if youâre interested in purchasing a new construction home, bring your Realtor. You donât know what you donât know. Put our experience to use to make sure youâre getting what you want and not paying for what you donât.If you donât already have a trusted Realtor, I would love to speak to you about how I help my clients save thousands buying their brand new home. I work through transactions like this every day. I would be happy to guide you through yours.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

Unfortunately, you donât have a lot of control over this at the moment, but your homeâs proximity to a Starbucks is key to its value. You may not be a coffee drinker, but a lot of people are, and a recent study by Zillow reported that homes located within a quarter-mile of a Starbucks increased 97% in value from 1997 to 2014. As you can see, being within walking distance of a cup of joe is worth a lot of money.âAnytime youâre thinking about making changes to your home, do them smart and do them right.â2. Painting certain rooms in your home blue.This task you have a little more control over. If youâve been thinking of painting the interior of your home to get it ready to sell, donât go with grayâgo with blue. According to reports, homes with blue kitchens sold for an $1,800 premium, and homes with light blue and periwinkle bathrooms can earn you an extra $5,000.Â 3. Add a barnhouse door or a farmhouse sink. If youâre remodeling, try getting back to your roots without actually feeling like it. Homes that touted âbarnhouse doorsâ and âfarmhouse sinksâ in their marketing sold 57 days faster and for 13.4% more than what was expected. These are easy remodels that are cool and trendy.Â Remember, anytime youâre thinking about making changes to your home, do them smart and do them rightânot just for yourself, but for the next buyer as well.Â If you have any more questions about how to upgrade your home to get top dollar for it or you have any other real estate needs, donât hesitate to give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "If you are thinking of buying a home this spring, then we have to talk right now to make this work for you.One of the things that I constantly keep an eye on is our inventory. Whatâs happening with prices and the number of homes available for sale?In October of 2015, we had 2.2 months of supply. In October of 2016, we had 1.7 months of inventory. This past October, we only had 1.1 months of supply.When I say there is only one month of inventory, that means that if no new homes came on the market, everything would be gone in just one month.Â That is the lowest amount of inventory that we have had in recorded history.There is a dip in the springtime, so what does that leave us with?Last spring, we were helping nine buyers. We found homes for seven of them, but we could not find homes for two of them. Last spring gave us a couple of black eyes. One buyer decided to buy in the south end of Puget Sound, while another decided to rent instead.It was really hard. We had to ask buyers if they wanted to pay for an inspection before they even made an offer because we had to find ways to be competitive.âPuget Sound only has 1.1 months of inventory, the least weâve ever seen.âIf last spring gave us two black eyes, this spring will probably give us that along with a bloody nose. If you want to be in a home this spring, we need to talk right now about how to make this market work for you instead of against you.The only ways buyers are going to have a chance is byÂ losing contingencies and raising offer prices.Â I would rather have you in a home by January or February and have that 10% price increase work in your favor instead of making you work even harder.One of my seller clients said, âSo if prices are going to be 10% higher this spring, shouldnât I wait until spring to sell?â Maybe. However, if you are looking to buy a home at the same time, you will still have to go out and buy in the spring market.No matter what market you are going to buy and sell in, you are going to buy and sell in that market. I recommend that you make that happen this winter. That way, you will have peace of mind in March, April, and May while everyone else is scrambling to find a home, because you already found the home that works for you.On the other hand, what if you donât need to buy another home after you sell your current one?In this market, even selling a home puts you in a high-pressure cooker atmosphere. When buyers are under pressure, they are not always so nice to deal with. Thatâs why we work to protect our sellers and get them top dollar in that pressure cooker environment.Letâs talk about your home needs and what we can do for you today to get you ready for the next six months. Just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!",

        "content": "Today, Iâve got one easy way you can pay your mortgage off sooner and ultimately for less money.If youâre an American today, youâve likely got a housing payment. This is true whether you rent or you own a home.The tip I have today can help regardless of where youâre trying to go, whether that is a paid-off mortgage or car, or getting to homeownership in general. Before I tell you what this tip is, understand that itâs a lot easier than it sounds.I recommend paying slightly more than you currently are. If this doesnât sound like saving money, let me explain.At the beginning of this year, I decided I wanted to be at a certain point in my mortgage at the end of the year.âIâm shaving 14 years off my mortgage by using this tip.âSo I found what I was paying in principal only each month, and where that would naturally put my mortgage balance by the end of the year.Then I subtracted my goal number from the number it would be without any different payment. I divided that difference by 12 (for each month).Â That number plus my regular payment was doable for me. If you are looking for wealth, use this tip.How much of a difference did this actually make? Well, using a loan term calculator that you can findÂ here, I did some math. It turns out that Iâm shaving 14 years off my mortgage.Â Additionally, Iâll save about $90,000 Â in interest that I wonât have to pay.Many of us are guilty of simply seeing a number on our statement and just paying that particular amount. But this doesnât have to be your strategy. Imagine all that you could be saving by using this simple tip. You can implement this incrementally, as well.Even if you pay just $50 extra per month on your mortgage, you would still be shaving time and money off your mortgage payments.These tips can help even if you arenât currently paying a mortgage.Â Letâs say youâre making car payments right now. Use the calculator to see how a little higher payment each month can make a big difference to your bottom line. This can apply to any payment plan youâre on.Now remember, if you need to take care of other areas of your finances before you can implement this strategy, visitÂ www.DaveRamsey.com.Be a great steward of your resources. What you have is what youâve been given to take care of.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.And of course, if you are looking to sell or to buy a home in the next few months, we can help you with that.I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "content": "There are a couple of great ways that you can be a hero around the Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner table.When I talk with my clients and friends about how we can help their family and friends with their home purchase or sale, I often hear something like, âMy sister would be a great person you could help.â Other times, I hear something like, âWell, my cousin Bob needs help, but you donât want to work with him.âWe may be able to help your cousin Bob andÂ make you a hero by being his real estate resource.Some of our family and friends can be hard to please. Let me decide who I can best work with.Since I work with them in a professional setting, I can be professional and let them know, âThis is what I can do for you.â That helps them see what can happen and how we can get them there.âNine times out of 10, I help these referrals and end up liking them in the process.âIt doesnât always mean that itâs going to be peaches and cream or that Iâm going to be sitting around eating pizza with them on a Seahawks game day. However, I can keep this transaction professional and still make them feel good since we were able to get their house sold.The first way you can be a hero is to tell your friend or relative, âYou should talk to Sandy. She has helped a lot of people over the last 14 years and she has Â great ideas to help you.âThe second is to tell them, âIâm going to have Sandy call you. Sandy has helped so many people in our area over the last 14 years. She is an expert and a resource. Sheâs patient and she will help you get through this process and get your next home.âWhether they need help buying or selling a home, introduce them to me. Let me decide whether theyâre too hard to work with. Usually I can set good professional boundaries. But if I canât help them, Iâll tell them up-front. I donât want them to spend a ton of energy and heartache on something that we both know isnât going to work out.That said, nine times out of 10 I do help them. And most of the time, I end up liking them in the process.So if you have a cranky cousin or needy friend and youâre not sure Iâll love them, just give me a call. Those people need help too, and I would be honored with the introduction.As always, if you have any other questions, please donât hesitate to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you!",

        "title": "3 Common Misunderstandings Smart Sellers Still Have",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Buying and selling real estate is a hot topic, both in the media and in casual conversation. A lot of people have experience buying and selling real estate, but sometimes that experience happened as far back as 20 years ago or in a different state than Washington. In real estate, things happen differently in different times and different areas.With that in mind, there are three main misunderstandings some of my smart sellers have had lately:1. Who pays for what?Â Sometimes sellers assume that in this hot sellerâs market they can get the buyer to pay their closing costs, right? Wrong. The seller always pays their own fees. Thereâs a title fee, an escrow fee, excise tax, and commissions. And the seller pays commissions for both the buyerâs and sellerâs agent. Remember, current prices reflect a market where the seller customarily pays those fees, so youâre actually getting the money for it, just not until the very end.2. What is personal property?I had a seller recently insist that the buyer pay him separately for his propane tank separately from the purchase price of the house. It took a while for him to understand that in this part of the country, the propane tank stays with the house because itâs connected to it and thatâs how it gets its fuel. A lawnmower, on the other hand, is something you could sell to your buyer separately from the houseâs purchase price.âTalk to a Realtor you can trust to lead you down the right path of making smart decisions.â3. What stays and what goes? My rule of thumb is if itâs wired in, it stays. If itâs screwed in, it usually stays. One of the most common misunderstandings is curtains and blinds, which always stay with the house. Obviously, these items are of a personal taste, so if theyâre something you want to take with you, by all means, take them down ahead of time. Donât let someone else fall in love with your curtainsâthatâs disrupted more than one sale at the end.Some of these things are common sense, and some can be a different way of viewing a real estate transaction. It doesnât mean youâre stupid; it just means youâve looked at something differently than the way itâs done here and now.This is why itâs so important toÂ talk to a Realtor you can trust to lead you down the right path of making smart decisionsÂ and you donât end up shooting yourself in the foot.If you have any questions about this how itâs really done or youâre thinking of buying or selling a home in our Puget Sound market, donât hesitate to give me a call or shoot me an email. Iâd love to help you..",

        "content": "If youâre thinking about selling your home in the near future, making some upgrades isnât a bad idea. However, you need to know the difference between which renovations you should do and which you should avoid.Weâve got six different upgrade tips for you today. Two of them are things you should absolutely do if they apply to you. Two of them are things that you want to do if you can afford them. There are also two upgrades that you shouldnât even consider.The Must Do&rsquo;s1. Your siding. If you have older siding that is buckling or expanding, itâs time to take a look at some new siding. Buyers will look at how well you took care of the structure of your home and if youâre letting water in through your siding, it doesnât matter what your kitchen looks like.2. Replace aluminum windows.Use vinyl, double-pane windows instead, so the buyer of your home has the lowest possible energy bills.The Want-to-Do&rsquo;s1. The kitchen. Making upgrades here can get you an 85% return on your investment. However, you want to keep the budget of this project within 20% of your homeâs value so you donât overbuild for your neighborhood.âReplace aluminum windows with vinyl.â2. The bathroom. Another area that can get you great bang for your buck is the bathroom. You can get up to an 80% return.The Don&rsquo;t Do&rsquo;s1. Combining small rooms into larger rooms. Any time you reduce the bedroom count in your home, its value is going to take a big hit, especially if youâre making a 3-bedroom a 2-bedroom. Thatâs going to drive away most of the families out there.2. Remodel the garage space. Buyers are going to be looking at your garage space in terms of if itâs going to keep their vehicles dry and warm. If you decide to make part of your garage space a living space, make sure you can easily turn it back into a garage when the time comes to sell.With any improvement or upgrade you make, itâs first about getting joy out of it while youâre living in the home and then secondly passing that joy onto the next owner.If you have any questions about any of these upgrades or any other decisions related to selling your home, give us a call or send us an email. We would love to hear from you.",

        "content": "You may know that buying and selling real estate is one of the top five most stressful things that someone can go through in their life, right along with death, divorce, and losing a job.One of my couples was buying a new home, and in the beginning it was a truly exciting time for them. But then they ran into an issue with the lender, who was creating problems where there werenât any.At one point, the husband told me something that I could totally relate to: âI know Iâm supposed to give this to God, but I just keep going back and picking it back up again.â Iâm sure you can relate to that.Then I began to look at their situation a little differently. God said repeatedly in the Bible, âRemember whenâ¦â Â Over and over, he provided for his chosen people what they needed, at the exact moment that they needed it. And then God told them to remember those times of his provision when they had another crisis. These memories built their faith and confidence. So I told my client, âI think the Lord is creating a âremember whenâ moment for you.âWe canât remember when he did great things for us if we didnât have those moments to go through in the first place. Later on, heâll remember that the Lordâs provision came through for him before. And it will again. Because Godâs goodness never changes- he is the same yesterday, today and tomorrow.âThe  Bible helps us understand whatâs happening in our lives at the current moment.âI reminded my client that even though the situation seemed hopeless to him, if he stopped worrying about what-ifâs and focused instead on building that airplane (heâs a Boeing guy), and let God take care of this, he was going to turn out okay. Ultimately, the lender referred us to someone else who could finish his loan. Eight days after we began working with this new lender, I was handing my clients the keys to their new home.God promises to provide for us. He says in Deuteronomy 31:6, âBe strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or terrified because of them, for the Lord your God goes with you; he will never leave you nor forsake you.â Thatâs echoed in Hebrew 13:5. Philippians 4:19 says âAnd my God will supply all your needs according to the riches of his glory in Christ Jesus.â All means ALL.The Bible helps us understand whatâs happening in our lives at the current moment. In the same way, our real-life issues arenât just earthly conversationsâthatâs why we must invite God into them on a daily basis.It was such a joy to be able to work with my client through this situation and share this faith experience with him. If there is anything that I can do to help you and your family, whether it be real estate or otherwise, please give me a call. I would be honored to help.",

        "content": "Summer can be a great time for some to-do list items around the house that are a little more weather-dependent. There are five things in particular that you should consider doing to your Puget Sound home this summer while the weatherâs fine:1. Paint: Houses get thirsty! They need to be caulked and painted, which are the first barriers for water damage in your house.2. Taking care of your windows: Popped seals are a common issue here, so now is the time to look into new vinyl windows. The perfect window is one that doesnât draw attention to the window itself, just whatâs on the other side.3. Fences: Look now while itâs sunny and (hopefully) not raining. Keep your fences strong to keep the pets in and add beauty to your property. There are plenty of options that will fit almost any budget whether thatâs chain link, cedar, or something in between.âWhere do you gather with your family and friends?â4. The driveway:This could mean just cleaning if there are no big cracks that trip people or chunks of grass growing through. Iâll even lend you my power washer if you need it! Is it time to pour new concrete? Options from aggregate to stamping designs can change your driveway to beautiful and inviting.5. Yard space:Â Where do you gather with your family and friends? Updating your yard can be as easy as putting in a fire pit, or you could go the outdoor kitchen route with a grill, oven, and a cover for year-round entertaining. Covered decks and patios are important in our part of the country where clear skies are a little less dependable. You could also add in some game spots like horseshoes or a volleyball net. Make your yard a place that you can enjoy as an extension of your home.If you have any questions or youâre looking for recommendations for the best tasks to tackle in your home this summer, or youâre looking to make a move this season, give me a call or send me an email.

If that doesnât work, maybe Iâll go work for NASA.âI asked, âWhy donât you go work for NASA and bake on the weekends?ââNah,â she replied, âI donât want to do all of that really big math.âChloe is good at really big math problems, but having to do that all the time was just not her cup of tea.

When we got ready to price their condo, we looked at what the most recent sales numbers were. We listed for the same as the last identical sale, knowing that the market would bring the price up all on its own.In a market like this, you want to be a little bit under where buyers will come in so they feel like they have a bit of control and they can then push you up to where you want to go and you can get the benefit of that competition.We priced the condo at $210,000 and lo and behold, we got six offers in three days.

The big question now whether the condo was going to appraise because it sold for so much higher than any comparable condos.âTo our surprise, the appraisal came in at $250,000.âWe knew we didnât have time to mess around if the appraisal came in low, so the sellers agreed that they would accept the price at whatever the appraisal came in at and move forward. To our surprise (and our excitement), the appraisal came in at $250,000! My clients got everything they needed and more. They are absolutely ecstatic and so are we.What does this have to do with pigs and hogs? Well, my lender has a phrase that goes like this: âPigs get fat but hogs get slaughtered.â Itâs one thing to get nice, fat, and sassy about where you could possibly sell your home at; itâs another to become a hog and demand that a buyer pay the price even if the appraisal comes in under that number and their lender wonât lend on the full amount. Just something to keep in mind if you or someone you know is in a similar situation.If you or someone you know needs the right person who can help them buy or sell in Puget Sound and make the right decisions along the way, give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "Last night, I had some first-time homebuyers ask me if they were ready to purchase and what I thought of their situation. In response, I had a couple questions for them. These questions are the same ones you need to ask yourself if youâre in a similar situation so you can make a plan to get the home you want.First, do you have an emergency fund?By this I mean a sum of at least $1,000 set aside for when certain things go wrongâmaybe the car needs new brakes or the hot water heater needs to be replaced. These are things that you know will happen at some point in the future, but you just donât know when. Itâs not an unexpected expense; itâs an unscheduled expense.âLet  me help you figure out a plan to get the home you want.âSecond, whatâs happening with your debt? Is it going up or down? If this sounds familiar, you might be listening to Dave Ramsey. If not, Dave Ramsey is a financial advisor who has sound financial sense, hates debt, and wants to make sure youâre constantly moving toward being on secure ground financially so you can do what you need to do for you and your family. I highly recommend you check out his site at DaveRamsey.com for more information.Lastly, have you made a plan to figure out how to chunk that debt away? If you donât have a plan, thatâs fine. Letâs talk about making one. If you do have a plan, letâs talk about how close you are and how you might accelerate yourself to be ready. Itâs not just about the house payment; itâs about whatâs going out and whatâs coming in.I want you ready for homeownership so you can look back and say âYou know what? This was awesome!â instead of âOh my word, Iâm hanging on by the skin of my teeth!âIf youâre interested in making your plan, give me a call so we can help you get ready to get that house.

Iâm going to answer it today.The direction the market is heading is a concern for both buyers and sellers.Â Sellers want to make sure they donât miss out on the top price, and buyers want to make sure they donât pay too much.Compared to last year, our growth has slowed a little bit. But make no mistakeâour market is still growing. Although we saw an incredible 13.2% growth in 2016 and that number is down to 10.4% in 2017, any appreciation rate close to 10% is outstanding.âThe question of âWhere is our market headed?â is one that I get a lot. Iâm going to answer it today.âAt the same time, our inventory is even lower than it was at this point last year. Last year, we had 1.2 months of inventory at this time, which is an extremely low figure. This year, that number dropped to 0.7 months, or just three weeks of inventory. Until that inventory bumps up in the summer, weâre going to have a bottleneck of buyers. The best way for them to compete is by making an offer above asking price.I see prices continuing to move up, but weâre in line for stabilization. When will that happen? I canât tell you, but I can tell you that if youâve been thinking about buying or selling a home, you need to give us a call or send us an email so we can discuss how the market relates to your individual situation.

        "content": "Life is like a box of chocolates, or maybe itâs like a bowl of cherries. Sometimes making big life decisions is like the Now and Later candy: all of the life decisions that you make have something to do with now and something to do with later. So, how do you make those big decisions?Some people Â can make a snap decision, jump right in, and everything turns out OK. Even when buying a home. Most of us take a slower pace. I want to encourage you to do three things when making those big decisions:1. Slow down to be wise.Â Often we can be distracted by the shiny and beautiful surfaces. We donât always look to see whatâs underneath. That can happen in all arenas of life. Let me encourage you to take a harder look and make sure that what you see is really what you get.2. Pray about it.Â Ask God, âWhat is it that you have for me and how does this fit in?â Donât be afraid of his answer. He might say no because he has something better in store for you later on. But he might actually say yes! Then you can be excited that you are being wise and that you are walking along the purpose he has designed for you as your creator.âMake sure that what you see is really what youâll get.â3. Talk to others.Â Talk to your spouse, parents, friends, or whomever you know who has a wise demeanor in this arena. Ask what they think about it. When I am looking at homes with single people, they donât always have another person to talk things over with and bounce ideas off. In that case, I am honored to be on their âBoard of Directorsâ and to help them weigh their options.When considering a home, there are several things you need to keep in mind. For instance, does it make you smile when you walk in the door? Is the property structurally sound? The house might be really pretty, but if the bones werenât taken care of, then you have a problem. You should also consider whether or not you have the resources for upkeep down the road.So when you make those big decisions, look at Now and Later. Go through a decision-process to ensure that you make a great decision now that will still be a great decision down the road.If you have any questions for me, please donât hesitate to give me a call or send me an email.

But there are a few things to do before you bring in that first box.First, look at your key. How many people have had access to your new home before you bought it? The previous owner may have given spare keys to friends, family members, and the neighborâs cousin. This is a good time to change those locks. Either call a locksmith to re-key your locks or buy new hardware and switch them out.Secondly, change out the air filter in the furnace. The previous owner had different scents, so make the home your own by breathing in that fresh air.âSwap that furnace filter out twice a year.âFinally, check out the toilet seats. Put seats on there that are clean and look good without any cracking paint or broken hinges.Soon youâll settle into daily life in the new home. That doesnât mean you should neglect home maintenance. Everyone forgets some of the regular maintenance routine, so we have a quick list of things to share that you should keep up with regularly in your home.  Service the furnace by swapping out the previously mentioned air filter twice per year.  Take a look at your attic and crawlspaces for any water leaks, mold, or pest intrusion.  Vacuum the refrigerator coils and under the stove. You use these things every day, so itâs smart to keep them clean, fresh, and working properly.  Flip your mattress. Itâs just like rotating your tires. Youâll get more life out of your mattress and probably a better nightâs sleep.If you have any questions for me at all, reach out.

        "content": "Have you ever made an impulsive decision and later realized you forgot to consider a number of important things? Many buyers just like you are afraid of this when a house is listed for sale and multiple offers seem to appear within minutes. This is what we help our buyers avoid. The last thing I want is for you to have buyerâs remorse when you make such a big purchase.âFinding the right home in this impulsive market comes down to being purposeful.âPurposeful is a word that gets used a lot. For us, it means helping our buyers know whatâs most important ahead of time. Then they know they made a wise decision when they bought a home. When we sit down with you for the first time, we talk about whatâs important to you and why. We go through categories to make sure youâve thought of everything. We talk about things like the number of bedrooms and bathrooms that you want. Then if you say you need two bathrooms, for example, does that mean you need a bathtub in that second bathroom or is a shower or just a powder room okay? These questions help us understand the reasons behind the amount of real estate you want.When my buyers tell me about houses they see somewhere else, I take a look at why they saw it and I didnât. Is there something I wasnât considering? Or was there something I thought was important thatâs not? One of the biggest factors is locationâa buyer might want a certain community, school district, or commute, but then send me a home thatâs two school districts away. Thatâs when we have that conversation about whatâs really most important.When we can back away from the house and talk about whatâs most important to you, then we can be purposeful and help you make the right choice. This isnât the market for buyers to jump up and grab whatever comes along. Itâs a market to be careful, wise, and patient. And when the right home comes along, jump quickly and aggressively to win the home they want.If thereâs anything we can do for you in this hot market, give me a call or send me an email today.

        "content": "You probably already know that when you sell a home, itâs not the same as when you live in a home. With that in mind, I have four tips for you to stage your home and sell for top dollar in todayâs market.My first tip is to make a good first impression becauseÂ the first impression is the lasting impression.Â Buyers take about three to five seconds to make that first impression when they pull up to the house, so clean up the exterior, add some color to the porch, and make sure your trim is freshly painted. When buyers walk into your home, you have another three to five seconds to cement that first impression.This leads me to my next tipâalways be show ready.Â In the mornings and evenings, take a look at each room and make sure everything is how you want a buyer to see the house as they walk through it. One great tip I got from Flylady.net is to go through your house every night and pick up the misplaced things you see in each room. Then, when you get the call that someone is coming for a showing, have a list of âhot spotsâ to take a look at where you know things tend to accumulate quickly.âUse these four tips to get your home sold today for top dollar.âMy third tip is toÂ take the âhomeâ out of your house.Â For example, you need to take personalized items like your family photos down. These photos cause buyers to see your family in the home instead of theirs. And the infamous photo wall hallwaysâ they make buyers uncomfortable from the lack of perceived space when walking down that hallway.Next, put away about one-third of your stuff. If you have extra bookcases, tables, or trunks that are making any walkways smaller or more inconvenient, remove them. Iâm not a fan of long-term storage units, but they can come in handy when storing these items in the short term. Also, make sure all your closets are half-empty. You want people to look inside of them and see that thereâs plenty of room for clothes.My last and most important tip is toÂ hire an informed, professional agent and price it right.Â Pricing is critical when it comes to getting your home sold for top dollar in todayâs market. I canât tell you how many times- even this last year- Iâve seen people list their home for more than itâs worth and end up taking even less than they should have in the end. Hire an agent whoâs doing business right now and understands whatâs happening in your neighborhood.If you have any questions about staging or are thinking about selling your home, please give me a call.

        "content": "Today, I wanted to talk about salesâhow I serve you, and how that service also serves me at the same time.Picture a salesperson. Sometimes, I hear from people about what that picture looks like to them. In the last month, Iâve had two people share their assumptions of what it means to make a living from sales. Their emphasis was on the âsalesâ portion of that paradigm. Let me tell you: at Sandy and Company, weâre on the opposite side.At Keller Williams Realty, just like in many other businesses, we have mottos. One of these is âCustomers always comes first.â If I canât get a customer what theyâre looking for, I will tell them. Likewise, when I believe I can help, I jump right in and make it happen.Going back to the two who shared with me. One of them said he knew I was tempted to withhold information about what might be wrong with the house in the name of getting the sale done. I told him that wasnât true at all. Donât get me wrong, I have temptations, but thatâs never one of them.In the other conversation, she assumed my goal is to push my clients to the very top of their purchase point. In theory, that would serve me best. Once again, I had to correct her. Thatâs never my goal. as long as we can meet their home needs for less. On the contrary, I love it when my clients purchase well below their price points.âMy job is to serve youânot the almighty dollar.âWhy? Because my goal is to make sure that I serve your whole life situation. This means whatâs most important is meeting your needs in the long run. If a client of mine purchases for less than they can afford, that means they could save extra money for other needs in their life. And when I serve you well, you are going to be so excited that someone is taking great care of you and giving you all of their expertise and knowledge. Youâre going to tell others about me, and that meets my needs in the long run.When Iâm in sales, there is a transaction happening, but what Iâm thinking about is how I can serve you today. If that means we make a transaction together, great! If not, Iâm satisfied as long as I know that I helped you. My clients know that about me, which make them comfortable to introduce me to their friends, family and colleagues.Just yesterday, some clients and I let go of a project we had been working on for six months. It was an arduous process, and we werenât sure it was going to work, but we gave it a shot anyway. When the numbers didnât add up in the end and my clients asked to kill the deal, I understood completely. My job is to serve youânot the almighty dollar.If youâre looking to buy or sell real estate, please give me a call or shoot me an email. If Iâm not the right person for the job, I promise you Iâll find someone who is. I look forward to helping you!",

        "content": "Our warm weather is winding down here, but one of the things I really enjoy about both summer and autumn is that both seasons give us a chance to get outside and play golf. Itâs a relatively new hobby of mine, and Iâve had a great time lately strengthening my game and thinking about how golf is like real estate.Golf is different than my previous hobbies like quilting, gardening, or scrapbooking. Then I could produce something tangible to show for my efforts. In golf, when I have a great score, I still feel like Iâve accomplished something.How does this relate to real estate? Real estate has an end product as well. Most of the time, you have a closing at the endâsomeone bought a house and someone sold a house. Whether my clients get a paycheck, a new home, or something off their shoulders that they donât have to think about anymore, itâs a great thing to look back on.âIn both golf and real estate, I can depend on feedback in order to get better.âAlso, when I make a mistake while golfing, I can ask for feedback from my group and advice to improve my game. When real estate issues come up, my amazing team provides feedback and advice on the best way to serve our client. Itâs very much a group effort, and we have something great to show for it at the end.As you may have seen from my Facebook post this summer, Iâm using the budget model of golf. This doesnât mean it costs less money: rather, Iâm squeezing every last penniesâ worth of value because my score(strokes) are so high. Iâm going to enjoy my game, appreciate the people around me, and learn from my mistakes.I was also fortunate enough to have been able to join golf and real estate in a literal sense when I sponsored a charity golf tournament this last summer for Leahâs Dream Foundation. Whenever I can put golf and real estate together, I get the chance to know people, serve them, and have a great time. So if I ever see you out on the golf course, be sure to come up and say hello!In the meantime, if youâre looking to sell or buy real estate, donât hesitate to give me a call or shoot me an email.

Sheâd finally found them a buyer, but she was not returning phone calls and took days to follow up on requests. They knew that on their next purchase they needed an agent who was much more responsive. We talked with our couple that day, looked at five homes the next day, made two offers that night, and had one accepted by the weekend. We accomplished this even though this purchase was contingent on the their existing home selling.Next, it was time to schedule the inspection. It was really a clean house overall, and the inspector didnât find many issues. Then we went out to the back porch, and the light wasnât turning on. I thought that maybe the bulb just needed to be replaced, but the bulb just turned in circles when I tried to unscrew it.âWe take active responsibility and make things happen.âWe asked the seller to make sure the light was working. To our surprise, they refused this simple repair. They said it had worked the night before, so the inspector must have broken it.

        "content": "When youâre thinking of buying or selling a house, what youâre really thinking about is yourself. You arenât thinking about your Realtorâs system and whether itâs set up to help you. Knowing whether that system involves working with a team or not, though, can prove critical.Some people might assume that more people means more problems, but thatâs not usually true. Let me share an example.Just this last month, we were working for one of our buyers who had a few hiccups in his transaction. When we initially wrote the offer, I knew his loan wasnât going to be the easiest. Still, it was only a matter of following a step-by-step process. Which is why we asked for a six-week closing.After the listing agent talked with the seller, she came back to me and asked,âCould we close sooner?âMy standard response to this request is,âSure, although we may ask for a couple extra days at the very end if we need them.â As per the listing agentâs wishes, we made the closing date sooner by about a week. From there, everything started moving forwardâthe client got the house, we completed the inspection and appraisal, and we were just about to get documents to escrow.âOn a team, everyone has to work together to find a solution.âJust before the underwriter fully checked off, however, she realized that my clientâs IRS auto-payment had not been deducted out of his account. Because we needed time to work with the IRS, we asked the seller for another week. Of course, the seller was not happy with this request. They were in the process of buying their own house, and they were getting charged by the builder every single day that they were late for that closing.I felt very responsible for this quagmire until my office manager reminded me that weâd originally asked for this closing date. With this in mind, we went back to the listing agent and asked for the time back that we originally gave them. Doing that made our responsibility much easier to handle and freed us up to find a solution.So you see that when we have more people involved in a transaction, we work more efficiently to get the job done. Let me know what we can do to get my team working for you, whether that means buying a house today or six months down the road.",

        "content": "What does it mean for us to go the extra mile for one of our clients? Let me tell you a story.A few months ago, I got an email from one of my past clients who needed to sell his home and buy a new one for him and his fiance. We were excited to help him. Ultimately, he chose a home in Monroe. We competed for this house against another buyer and won. When we scheduled the inspection, though, we found that the roof was toast and asked the seller to replace it.The seller took this request hard because he had just put $20,000 into the house to fix it up after he had renters in it. Since he decided it was too much for him to handle, we offered to split the cost with him. We raised the price of the house a little bit, but that wasnât a problem for my buyer because he was going to get the full value of that roof. To give the seller confidence that we werenât going anywhere after they put another $7,000 into their house, we also agreed to make our earnest money non-refundable after the roof was finished.Everything moved along nicelyâ¦until the house didnât appraise. We went back and forth a couple times with the seller and his agent, but the seller wouldnât budge. He wanted every single penny that he had originally been promised. My buyer, though, was not going to pay more for the house than he could finance, and he wasnât going to pay more than what it was worth.âOn our team, we work to find solutions.âAt this point, we started talking with our lender about different finance options that could breathe life into this transaction. My lender suggested raising the interest rate a little bit so that instead of my buyer having to bring in his money to pay for his own closing costs, he could use it as a down payment and cover the roof expense. The process was a tad complicated, but the numbers equaled out in the end and my buyer was excited to hear about this compromise.When I emailed our proposal to the sellerâs agent, I got no response. So I reached out again, with still no response. I decided then that I needed to jump in and make this deal personal. In our business, we donât have a lot of face-to-face conferencing anymore. Communication in todayâs real estate transactions rely on text and email. I decided, though, that it was time to show up at this agentâs office. I cleared my calendar and got in my car. When I arrived, he was in the middle of a meeting. I waited for him to finish.Once we got the chance to actually talk face to face, he relayed his sellerâs frustration to me. He had already put so much work into the house, he shouldnât have to bite the bullet and eat the whole expense. When I pointed out the counter-proposal that Iâd sent to him, he hadnât even seen it yet. He asked whether my buyer had agreed to this proposal. He promised to contact the seller and get back to me right away. The seller wasnât excited, but it was a good middle-ground compromise. They took our proposal.Now my buyer and his fiance are having their first Christmas together in their new home. All because I went a little old-school and met face to face to explain our proposal.Â  Thatâs what I mean by going the extra mile for my clients.If youâre looking for an agent who is willing to be a part of the solution, Iâm your gal. If youâre interested in buying or selling or just want to hear how todayâs market affects you, please donât hesitate to call me or send me an email. Weâre happy to help!",

        "content": "Fall can be a really exciting time. The leaves start turning, the air gets crisp, and the holidays are just around the corner. When everything is groovy around you â the roof over your head is solid and your cupboards are full â itâs easy to think of the fall as a harvest time, a time of ample supply. Unfortunately, that is not the case for everyone.In the Marysville community, we have a large population of people who are either hungry or on the verge of hunger. This is true in every community, including Everett, Stanwood, and Lake Stevens. Jesus said that the poor will always be with you, but we donât want them to be the same people all the time. Itâs really important to make sure that we do what we can as the hands and the feet of Jesus, caring for our neighbors.Jesus also said that when you give out a cup of water in His name, you are giving it to Him. We need to help our communities in tangible ways. October is the food drive month for Realtors, and thatâs why Iâm sending you this. If you can, please drop off food or cash donations to our office and we will deliver them to the Marysville Food Bank. I can even swing by and pick up your donations from you.If you are not from Marysville but would like to support the food bank, let me know. I can put you in touch with someone either in Marysville or in your own community. Remember, itâs important to give where you live.âLetâs be good neighbors to each other.âOne reason the food bank is so near to my heart is that when I was a child, we often got those baskets of food. We got the commodity cheese, powdered scrambled eggs, and powdered milk from the government. I didnât even like real milk when I first tried it because I wasnât used to it. Itâs very important to me that when I am experiencing abundance that I give back as well. Please help us be a resource for others.If you are on the other side of this â if you are struggling right now, please let me know. I can put you in touch with someone who can help you. The Everett Gospel Mission not only helps people with housing, they will also give you a bag of food. They even have a little store that you can walk through complete with household items, clothes, and food that you can have for free.So this fall, letâs be good neighbors to each other. If you are my neighbor and you need help, please open up. I am here to help you. At Keller Williams, we are a team. TEAM stands for Together Everyone Achieves More. Letâs work together to put food on the table for our neighbors and make our community a great place to live.Again, if you have any donations for our food bank, just drop them off at our office at 1027 State Ave #102 in Marysville. If you canât make the trip, let me know and I will collect the donations for you. I look forward to hearing from you!",

        "content": "Today I wanted to tell you a story about a Baby Boomer buyer we just helped downsize and why sheâs so excited about her brand new home in her retirement years.I got a call from a lender with a client who was very stressed outâshe had a nearly 4,000 sq. ft. house with three living spaces and a huge garage. It was an older brick home that needed some paint and just some all-around love. The payment was also huge, nearly $4,000. It was just too much.She has been working hard all her life and is coming up on retirement. She was also having a hard time making ends meet because of this monstrous payment and all the maintenance required. So my lender spoke with her about her whole financial situation and found that she was in a position to buy a reverse mortgage.Now, a reverse mortgage is not for everyone and there are some important criteria to consider, so Iâll refer you to my lender for that conversation if itâs one you want to have.âWhere are you in the cycle of your home life?âWith the reverse mortgage, our buyer was able to put down a significant chunk for a down payment, and now sheâs not going to have a payment for the rest of time she lives in her home. All she has to do is maintain her insurance, taxes, and the home itself.When looking at houses, she needed something with separate spaces for both herself and her adult son who lived with her. We were able to find her a split-level home where he has the lower level and she has the upstairs, and the home is much newer than her previous home. Itâs perfect for them.And this was the very first house we looked at. We looked at a couple others, but the first house ended up being her perfect home. It really does happen once in a while. Weâre getting her previous home ready for the market, and we know it will be perfect for someone needing more space.If youâre looking into your retirement years and youâre thinking about your house and your mortgage, Iâd love to talk with you about it. The question is thisâwhere are you in the cycle of your home life? Give me a call or send me an email and weâll talk soon.",

        "content": "It is a tough market out there for buyers right now and itâs important that you work with the right agent. Our team works hard to help buyers win in this market, and you should make sure you work with an agent who knows how to compete with other offers.Last weekend, I was doing an open house for one of my sellers. It was a hot listing that went on the market Wednesday and by Saturday, we already had a full-price offer in place. However, we still held open houses that weekend because we had already said we would wait to review offers that Monday.One of the buyers who walked in had seen our advertising and really wanted to check out the home. However, they were also bummed because they had just lost out on a house. I said, âI know, itâs a pretty tough market out there. Weâre doing a lot of escalation clauses.â I mentioned a few other things we do to help our buyers get ahead in the current market, and they just said, âWhatâs that?âTheir reaction really gave me pause because we talk about how we can help our buyers win so frequently that it just becomes an automatic part of our process. There are tools you can use to make your offer better than someone elseâs and there are ways to put your best offer forward. You donât have to max out your budget right away; you can start out softer so that you are able to get stronger down the line, and we can help you get that house.âWe have tools and strategies to help buyers win in this tough market.âI took the time to educate this buyer, which still benefits my seller. âLetâs say we have a full-price offer. Here is how you might craft your offer to get the home.â They hadnât heard any of these strategies before. But they still thought it didnât matter because the main problem was the seller probably wouldnât pay the closing costs. My answer? âThatâs no problem at all!âMost sellers are willing to pay closing costs, especially if they get the price they want for the house. I gave them a few different points to make their offer better. They went back to their own agent and wrote their own offer. The agent called me the next day with some questions. The buyer wound up getting the house for $15,000 less than their max and my seller was able to get $5,000 more than they expected, even after paying the buyersâ closing costs.We can make this happen for you. Donât assume that just because your agent is part of a big team means they will know, understand and use all of the strategies necessary to win in this tough market. Talk to your agent about what happens when youâre in a bidding war. If youâre not sure what questions to ask them, give me a call and I can help you out.If you have any other real estate questions, please donât hesitate to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you!",

That means, basically, rolling the profit youâd make from that sale directly into your next purchase.In our market, itâs the perfect time to sell. Is it the perfect time to buy for an investment property, though?Letâs say you sell a 1,500 square foot house and buy a 2,500 square foot house. Then, letâs say you sold that slightly bigger house and bought a duplex. With those three purchases, youâre getting a bigger investment and putting your equity to work for you by having your tenants pay rent, and still not paying any capital gains tax. Youâre delaying paying any meaningful taxes until further down the road when youâre not in your strongest income years.âIf youâre an investor, you need to think about using a tax deferred exchange.âThe question, then, isnât whether investing in real estate is a good idea, but how to do it in a savvy manner.

        "content": "What do you know about the wax rings on toilets? Itâs a very sexy topic, I know.I recently had two different clients whose inspectors found leaking toilets. In fact, one of the leaks had spread underneath both the bathtub and the surrounding ceramic tile floor. And the seller refused to handle that repair, so my buyer inherited this problem.This turned out to be a $10,000 repair job!Do you know how much a new wax ring around that toilet would have cost? About $8. If that seller had replaced the wax ring when needed, the entire $10,000 repair job could have disappeared. Good thing my buyer is planning to do some remodeling in the future, but he still had to spend $2,500 to repair just the minimum damage.âWouldnât you spend $8 to save $10,000?âSo this led me to do some research on toilet maintenance (yeah, itâs a glamorous job being your Realtor resource!). After all, itâs hard to notice a leak when itâs under ceramic tile. What I found is that a properly installed wax ring should protect for 10 to 20 years. So even if all seems well but it has been 10 or 12 years, pick a day. Drain the toilet and replace the wax ring, because it doesnât cost much at all.And do it right! Failing to install a wax ring properly can be just as expensive as having it fail on its own. Further, it can also cause dangerous sewer gas to enter your home.That ring connects the toilet to the floor, acting like a caulking that keeps water and sewer gas from leaking out. But even if you want to hire a professional to ensure itâs done completely correctly, it will only cost you a couple hundred bucks, instead of $10,000!  Itâs not worth the risk!If you notice any issue with your floor, take care of it quickly. $8? or $10,000? I know which one Iâd rather leave in my pocket.If you have more questions, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!",

This is a really complicated transaction though, with legal and physical issues, lender criteria, and much more in between. Itâs our job to understand this process so we can assure your success down the road.We track when your loan gets out of the underwriting process, so you have time to sign disclosures and have the correct documents reviewed. There may also be agreed-upon repairs to inspect prior to closing. Sometimes these repairs arenât done to the buyerâs satisfaction, which can cause a lot of heartache and delay.We deal with the appraiser who may expect things to be done a certain way as well. Appraisers canât simply take our word that repairs were done right on the home - they re-inspect as well. Many things happen in 30 to 45 days, and much gets pushed into the last two weeks.âWeâll make sure you have a Plan A, B, and C to achieve your real estate goals.âBoth buyers and sellers have other issues going on in their lives, which also complicates matters. For instance, the seller may be buying a new home too, and theyâre being held accountable to their seller to get the funds for their closing. If they canât close on the home youâre buying, they may not be able to close in time on their next home. Itâs extremely stressful. Consider services like a moving truck as well: many are booked three weeks in advance, and canât accommodate changes on two daysâ notice.My job as a consultant is to talk with you about all these different issues and to ensure that youâre prepared for Plan B and maybe even Plan C.

It might seem tempting to just skip this step, but as youâll see, it can have some horrendous consequences.A client of mine is currently buying a home here in Washington. However, he needs to sell his home in Alaska first. Things were going just great until he found out that there was a problem with the garage he had built behind his Alaska home. The county found that the garage was built three feet into the setback from the property line. He had to go in front of the zoning board to ask for a variance to be able to sell his property with the garage. They said no.Now the owner has to take three feet off his garage, and that involves removing the stairs, the roof, and changing the foundation.âItâs important to consider all the possible consequences.âHe thought he was making the right move because he was very handy and knew how to build a garage. What he did not take into account was that he needed a permit. If he would have spent the $100 or so to get the permit, he could have discovered the setback and updated his building plans accordingly.Now it is going to cost him more than $18,000 to remove three feet from the corner of his garage. Weâre confident that weâll be able to find a solution in the end, but the transaction is a hot mess right now. Heâs wishing he got that permit right about now, and you would too if this happened to you.So, when youâre considering a remodel or home improvement project, ask yourself what the possible consequences could be. If theyâre anywhere near the trouble that this seller had to go through, go ahead and get a permit. It will save you much more in the long run.UPDATE: As it turns out, this my client had originally gotten the permit for his garage. However, he changed the project plans after getting the permit and did not check with the county. He wanted the lines of the garage to match his house instead of the property line. So he turned the garage, and thatâs when the corner of the garage pushed into that setback.Since he didnât follow up with anyone about his permit after changing the plans, heâs dealing with a lot of heartache along with the almost $20,000. He lost his Alaska buyer and the Washington home he was hoping to move into.This is still a lesson in not only acquiring a permit, but following a permit closely.If you have any questions for me donât hesitate to give me a call or send me an email.

We really pushed the top of the market with our price, and we were hoping for one or two good offers. We had several people come through multiple times, and the right buyer showed up.We secured a full-price offer for our sellers, and the home sale just closed. This family decided to rent so they have the flexibility to decide where they want to settle in the next year. They have 1,500 less square feet to clean, pay $1,000 less per month on their rent, and they accomplished all of this in todayâs market.We are at the peak of the market, the growth is slowing.

That means weâre operating in a heavy sellerâs market. If no new homes come on the market in the next 27 days, we would be left without any homes to buy or sell.So, what does this mean for buyers in Puget Sound? Youâll have to fight other buyers if you find a home that you like. On a recent showing with a buyer, we encountered another buyer completing an inspection even before they made an offer on the home. Of the five offers the agent received, four out of these five families opted to get pre-inspections done. Traditionally, this inspection happens after a seller accepts a buyerâs offer. This means that the other three families just spent $300-$400 on an inspection, and they didnât even win the house.âYour home will sell before you can bat an eye.âSo what advice are we giving buyers? We recommend that you donât fall in love with a home when you walk in. Be realistic - this market is crazy and you might just have a home swept out from under you by a buyer thatâs even more eager than you. If youâve fallen in love and lost the home, then you will have a hard time acting when you have another opportunity. Also, youâre going to have to make some sacrifices if you want your dream home. Size, money, or finishes- youâre either paying more or getting less.However, we have just helped two buyers win bidding wars on homes, so it is possible and we know how to win over sellers.For sellers in Puget Sound, we have one simple question; what are you waiting for? Get your home on the market immediately if you want to sell! Your home will sell before you bat an eye.If youâre looking to buy or sell in Puget Sound, please donât hesitate to contact me. You deserve an expert at your side to navigate you through this tough market!",

        "content": "Iâm here recounting my interview with Sylvia Anderson. Unfortunately, we experienced some technical difficulties during recording, so I want to recreate it for you. The last portion of our talk focused on the challenging position of her team, including helping people in crisis and supporting them.I asked Sylvia how she keeps strong for her clients. She has to keep herself refreshed, or she gives out stale water, she said. One way is that when sheâs off the grounds she leaves her work at the office.Since weâd been talking about how they make it clear to their clients that theyâre the same, I wondered how transparent are they with clients? âWe have to be careful because clients are in their own crisis, and if we share our current crisis, then they jump on board to solve our issues. Itâs a welcome but unhealthy diversion, so we only share situations that weâve come through and had victory in or have learned lessons from.ââEveryone needs a support system.âCurrent staff struggles are saved for sharing outside the EGM circle. Sylvia continued that everyone needs to have a support system of two people in their lives; one we can let see us in our weakness and another who can be a truth teller, who has permission to take us aside and share a hard truth we need to hear.So to give back, I wanted to show you how you can learn more about the mission. You can go to their website at www.EGmission.org. They offer poverty awareness training, volunteering opportunities, and tours. Theyâre always happy to talk about their mission. There are resources for all people in the community who need help, whether they are homeless, struggling to maintain their home, or dealing with the associated struggles.I asked Sylvia for any final thoughts. She said, âWe have a responsibility to the poor. Isaiah 43 says âbring my sons from afar and my daughters from ends of the Earth, everyone who is called by my name who I created for my glory whom I formed and made.â Thatâs what weâre doing; bringing in Godâs sons and daughters, and if weâre not giving away to people who have no way to give back to us, then weâd better check our faith.â",

        "content": "I recently had an amazing conversation with Sylvia Anderson of the Everett Gospel Mission. We talked a lot about faith and life and although the audio was cut short, I want to share some of the things we talked about with you. This is part two of our interview.The message Sylvia shares the first time someone walks in their door is that we can all have faith that God is there and is for us. So I asked, âWhat about the second or third time someone comes in? How do they believe you this time when their circumstances are the same as before?â Sylvia responded that she is so glad God doesnât just meet her in her addictions the first time around the mountain, He is there every time. We all have addictions, and when we say that our addictions are âbetterâ than others, weâre setting up ourselves as the judge. Put another way, her clientsâ struggles are no bigger to God than her struggles.  We are all valuable and human, and she shares that message with her clients at the Everett Gospel Mission.âSeeds take time to grow.âAfter all, how many times have you dealt with something over and over, only to finally resolve the issue? Besides, when a client comes back to EGM after being back on the street, they are not the same person as before. Theyâve grown and theyâve learned. If they see something happening around them thatâs not right, maybe before it didnât bother them. And now it does. That is change to be celebrated.Sometimes seeds take a while to grow. Change doesnât happen overnight. Sylvia was recently with a gentleman who was getting ready to sign a lease, but was hesitantâ he had never signed a lease on his own. He was 50 years old! With the support of the Everett Gospel Mission, he signed that lease and is doing well.This is just an example of the success stories that Sylvia and the Everett Gospel Mission are seeing. Every situation is different and people constantly change and grow. When you have support from family, friends, and Jesus Christ, anything is possible.Stay tuned for part 3 of our conversation, where we will handle being emotionally supportive of the people in your life. I canât wait to see you soon on the next step of this faith walk.",

        "content": "I recently had the pleasure of speaking with Sylvia Anderson, the CEO of Everett Gospel Mission. Sheâs been there for about 20 years. I took a few notes from our conversation and wanted to share those with you today.First of all, a little information about Sylviaâs background. When she started working with the Everett Gospel Mission, she wasnât quite sure what it was all about. So after eight months, she asked the board if she could stay and has been here ever since. She has two children, one adopted, and has also fostered a number of children.When she was fostering, Sylvia didnât realize she was training for her work with Everett Gospel Mission. Thereâs a strong correlation between foster care and homelessness: 40% of the homeless population has been in foster care.Sylvia and I were talking about faith, and one of the first questions I asked her was, âHow do you share faith with a group of people who may not see a lot of reason for faith?â She responded that actually, a lot of their clients have very strong faith. They get on their feet every morning searching for what they donât see.âThe Everett Gospel Mission sees the homeless as Jesus would.âSylvia said, âFaith is the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen.â Sylvia gets the privilege of speaking with these people and helping them strengthen their faith that has already kept them going. They just donât know the name behind it, so she and her staff have the opportunity to introduce them to Jesus, who has been with them and they may not have realized it.âWhen we realize that the homeless are strong, valuable people, that helps alleviate judgment.â  The Everett Gospel Mission looks at people as Jesus would see them. Part of their mission is to open the eyes of the community to see the value in every person.The Everett Gospel Mission works to build connections between the homeless and the rest of the community. When someone loses their home, they can also lose their sense of belonging. Sylvia wants to make it clear that they have a respectful, strong community of people at the Everett Gospel Mission and this is where they belong.Sylvia and I talked for a while, so watch out for parts two and three of our discussion in the next few days. If you have any questions, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to talk with you.",

        "content": "Today weâre talking about how youâre killing your home with kindness. I bring this up because spring is approaching and youâre probably going to be making some improvements to your home. Most of the time the work you do will improve your home, but sometimes it can actually take away from the value of your property.Today we will discuss four different ways that you could be hurting your home instead of helping it.  Donât buy light bulbs that are too bright. Bright homes are good, but buying bulbs that are too powerful can be a fire hazard. Also related, I recommend incandescent bulbs for when youâre showing your home because they warm up quickly.  Donât plant trees near driveways and near your slab. Trees should be at least 10-20 feet away from paved areas, and this is also true for septic drainfield areas. The roots will destroy your driveway, and you donât want a buyer to inherit this problem.  Overzealous pressure washing. Itâs easy to damage the wood on your deck or your siding by power washing it too vigorously. Be careful and use the right nozzle, or just hire a professional to do it. And stay off your roof with your pressure washer!!  If you store firewood in your home, make sure it is cured and dried. Fresh wood will likely have dormant insects nesting in it, and when you bring it into your warm home, the bugs will leave the wood and enter your home. Only store a few pieces of dry wood at a time if youâre looking for ambiance.If youâd like to learn more, ask me for a copy of 19 Ways Youâre Killing Your Home with Kindness.",

The home and property were beautiful, but it had all the original features in it. Itâs what we affectionately call vintage,requiring at least $60,000 in updating to make this home shine again.We listed the property in the range to accommodate the repairs. We got lots of showings but everyone had a bigger number in their head for repairs, so we inched the price down just a little more. There was nothing else with acreage in-town, so we gave it a little longer and kept holding open houses. Within a few days, we got two full price offers and then a third offer willing to pay $5,000 above what anyone else put down.âWe got two full price offers and then a third offer willing to pay $5,000 above what anyone else put down.âWhen it was all said and done, we had three different offers resulting in $13,000 above the listed price.

They were looking for a home that fit them and their three large dogs and property with breathing room between them and neighbors. We looked for about a year, but nothing worked perfectly. Then their landlord told them that he was selling the rental they lived in. Urgency kicked in- they needed a home that they could count on rather than try to find another landlord who would allow their dogs.We found them a great house next to forestry land- country living and trails through the the forestry acres to walk the dogs. But the night we all came to agreement, a windstorm knocked three trees into the house.I communicated with the listing agent regularly and then the contractor to see how work was going. Unfortunately, after two months, we realized we were no closer to work starting on the home and needed to keep looking.âWe work hard to find security for our buyers.âKeeping this contract in place as a back-up, we chose a rambler that was perfect for their needs. It was more money, and it had a long honey-do list that came with it, but the home and property worked better for my clients than the âtree-house.â We helped them get bids on a couple of the projects to make sure they werenât biting off more than they could chew. And our lender handled their financing which was a little tricky. After weâd cleared all the obstacles on this perfect home, we let the first house go.Now our friends are securely in their own home with elbow room that theyâll treasure for many years to come.We work hard to find security for our buyers so that they have a plan B should their initial plan fall through. The beauty is that sometimes Plan B turns out even better than Plan A.

We would love to hear from you!âSandy is one of the most positive, upbeat, motivated, caring and just plain nice people I have ever worked with.  I believe she is actually interested in helping improve the lives of each and every client that is lucky enough to have come in contact with her.We had a unique situation with pretty specific needs in finding the right house.   We searched and searched with Sandy and her team, looking at house after house.  We looked at so many I was worried about Sandy giving up on us.  She never did at all.  We finally found âthe houseâ and Sandy negotiated a great deal for us.  The very night we signed the agreement the winds came up and blew not one but three trees down on the house destroying much of the upper level.  Sandy was out there with us every step again and when it became apparent the repair project would not meet our time frame needs, it was off to look at more houses.  I just knew now she had to be sick of us and would send us on our way to find another agent, but not a chance.  With the same care and energy from day one she set out to find us a great home.  After many more appointments and miles and miles of travel for Sandy and her team, we found an even better home in a beautiful location with plenty of room and trees to enjoy for years to come.  I am amazed that Sandy always had the same big smile and enthusiasm at each property we viewed and I believe that that through all this journey to find our home we were so very lucky to have come across Sandy Eagon.â  - John.

When buyers have more options, you are less likely to sell your home quickly and for top dollar. Listing now is a great way to avoid getting lost in the crowd.        Winter buyers are more motivated. In our part of the country, we get a lot of rain, wind, and sometimes snow in the winter. And yet, we still have people purchasing homes! This happens because there are always people that need to make a move in the next 30 days. The people out looking now are extremely serious about buying a home soon.        Your competition doesnât look perfect right now either. There arenât many homes on the market right now, and the ones that are donât look as good right now as they will later.

They needed someone here in Puget Sound to manage the home sale, and we were happy to fulfill their need.We marketed their home aggressively in many ways, including knocking on doors to let neighbors know about the new listing.It was a nice ranch-style rambler with a three-car garage and an open back yard. When we held an open house, several neighbors came through and we ended up getting three offers on the property! We negotiated and accepted the best offer for our client.That very night, the house was broken into. Fortunately a neighbor noticed and called us- we called our client and then the police immediately. Whoever broke in had started setting up a drug operation. We cleaned up the house, posted signs that the house was being watched and instructed the neighbors to call 911 immediately and us second this time. No need, our prompt response let the drug makers know they should go elsewhere.âWe took care of everything for our client.âAfter this happened, we coordinated with the police to make sure that only certain people were allowed in the home. The neighbors kept a great eye on the house, and we had a lot of conversations to make sure everyone was safe.That is one downside to vacant homes. Unfortunately, they are vulnerable to break-ins. Luckily, we were here to repair the damage and make a plan to prevent further incidents.We moved smoothly to closing until the last weekend. They sellerâs car broke down so he couldnât get here to finish the final clean up and dump runs. We had promised the buyer in the contract that the house would be clean and ready.

        "content": "Recently, we sold a pretty unique property for a seller of ours, and today weâre talking about what we did to sell that home quickly and for top dollar. I got a call this summer from a colleague in the lending field who was ready to sell his home.They had 5 acres, complete with a huge shop, apartment, barn, and private lakefront in a quiet area of Arlington. It was an awesome property, and there were quite a few agents competing for their listing. I put my best foot forward, told them I would earn their business, and showed them how. When they trusted me to list their home, we put together a game plan to make it happen.The first part of the plan was marketing. We posted the listing on all of the online portals we usually do, with the addition of some specific sites where we knew the horse owners would be looking.Since we know 70% of homes get sold through the local MLS, we had to make sure the agents out there knew exactly all we had here. We invited them to an open house for brokers, where we toured them through the great big shop and barn on the property.âWe ended up getting 2 full-price offers for the home.âWe had four strong buyer candidates in just the first weekend. None of them needed everything, so one by one the buyers started pulling out. But we knew the value was there. We continued marketing the property and each week we added another piece to get some extra exposure.Sure enough, we had a buyer come in from out of town who was looking for a lakefront property. They came out and looked, and we started negotiating from there. Then another buyer who had looked and been asking questions offered, and we ended up getting 2 full-price offers for the home. Ultimately, we sold it to the out of town buyer, and ended up delivering a nice profit check to our sellers.If you are looking for someone to sell your home who takes the time to understand your unique situation and use it to your advantage when marketing the property, we would love to sit down with you and talk about how we can get you the most amount of money in your pocket today.If you have any questions for us, feel free to give us a call or send us an email.

We contested some points of the appraisal, but ultimately, the appraisal stood. What that tells me is our market is definitely stabilizing, so sellers canât reach that higher ground now. My broker even told me that if our listings had not sold, we need to make a 10% price drop.The good news is that we donât have any listings that havenât sold, but this is just another sign that the shift Iâve been talking about for the last couple months is happening now.ââWhat does this shift mean? What do I need to do for my clients? Basically, I can report on the market and let you know how you can be successful. For sellers, this means we need to be a bit more conservative. We will have open conversations about what you can expect, and how you can get top dollar in this market.The market is warming up to buyers. This gives buyers confidence, so we need to make sure your home is priced correctly as the market continues to slide. If youâre thinking about selling, now is the time to do so.Buyers may lose confidence as prices go down, but with low interest rates, now is the time to buy. What you can afford to purchase will be better now than it will be next year, when weâre looking at higher interest rates. Iâm actually purchasing myself because right now, buyers can afford a better house for a lower monthly payment. If youâre buying now, have confidence. Youâve made a great decision!If youâre making a decision about buying or selling, sit down and talk with me about your specific situation.

We got another offer fairly quickly. We were told that this buyer was making a cash offer, but then we got a call from a lender asking for certain documentation before they would send us the money.âWe will do everything we can to make the closing happen!âA lot of people wanted to fire the buyer.

Putting an entire new roof on a home is expensive, so this is a very important question.âIf you skimp on your roof, buyers will think youâve skimped in other placesâIf you have composition shingles on your roof, you can either replace sections of it, replace all of it, or put a new layer over the old layer, but this depends on multiple factors. One way to tell if you need to remove the old before putting on the new is to look at the edges of the roof and up in your attic crawlspace. If you can see rot or damage on the plywood sheeting, you should remove and replace it along with the new layer of shingles.Itâs important to keep in mind that cutting corners like  covering up rotten plywood will send messages to the buyer that youâve been cutting a lot of corners and covering up problems elsewhere in your home.

This means that if no other homes were listed, in just over a month all available homes would be sold. When the market was that hot, buyers had to scramble and act quickly if they were going to get the right house. Since then, inventory has built slowly to where we are now, at 1.8 monthsâ supply. Although it doesnât seem like much difference, it does allow our buyers to put their best foot forward after thinking about it for more than 5 minutes.For sellers, weâre still getting full-priced offers in competitive situations. However, the offers arenât coming in quite as quickly as they were earlier this summer.

We actually only have 1.3 months of inventory right now. However, we expect a seasonal rise in inventory to help buyers find good homes.

For sellers, this means that you need to price your home so that many different buyers can afford your home if you want to capture the largest possible audience. Homes that are priced well and in good condition are selling very well, and sometimes even for more than the asking price. However, buyers are more savvy than they used to be and they will not overpay for homes very often unless they are really in love with a property.The important thing to remember is to price your home correctly when youâre selling, because even though inventory is low, buyers arenât willing to pay a whole lot extra.Hopefully this information is useful to you if youâre planning on buying or selling a home in Puget Sound this summer.

My answer is always NO because multiple surveys have revealed that you donât get your investment back when you sell your home. Instead, you can just clean your kitchen and countertops extremely thoroughly. Although it may not have the same appeal as granite, your kitchen will be spotless and will signal to the buyer that your home is in good shape.âRepainting and putting in new carpet are pretty solid ways to add value to your home when you go to sell later on.âAnother thing you need to do is repaint the interior of your home. Pets and kids can really wreak havoc on the walls, and the same goes for carpeting. If your carpet is more than one to two years old, then I would highly suggest getting new carpet and repainting your home in light earth tones. Repainting and putting in new carpet are pretty solid ways to add value to your home when you go to sell later on.One last thing that you might consider if you have hardwood floors is to refinish them. This can add a nice touch, and buyers will be appreciative that you went the extra step and had this done to your home.If you donât have the time to do these things for yourself, I know excellent contractors that can come in and get this job done quickly and efficiently.As always, if you need assistance when youâre buying or selling in Marysville, please donât hesitate to contact me.",

There is so much for us to do -  we have mountains, oceans, and much more.My daughter will be turning 18 this summer, and weâve decided that weâre going to take a Clipper Tour up to Victoria. Weâre also going to be visiting Butchart Gardens while weâre there, and weâre extremely excited to be planning this trip.âThere is so much for us to do -  we have mountains, oceans, and much more.âWeâre also going to be heading to Mt. Rainier to do some camping and fishing, and I cannot wait to smell trout cooking on the campfire. Iâve always liked camping and spending time in the outdoors, and the options are limitless in our area. Weâre extremely blessed to live in an area like this with so much to offer.Another favorite day trip of mine is in Friday Harbor on San Juan Island. There is a very inexpensive ferry you can take to see the wildlife, and you can take this trip in early spring.We would love for you to share ideas on what you do for fun in this area. Weâre always looking for new adventures.As always, please refer to us with any questions you might have about our local real estate market. Weâre always here to help you - except for when weâre out enjoying this beautiful area!",

        "content": "In order to prepare you for a successful spring real estate transaction, Iâd like to share some information with you in the hopes that you can use it to your own advantage when you enter the real estate market.  Home prices are rising slightly because of increased competition from spring home buyers.  There is only a month and a half of inventory, and this is driving up prices as well.  Home prices should soften up after the spring when there is less competition.  With low interest rates, (sitting right around 3.75%) more buyers will be able to afford homes, and sellers will also reap the benefits of this increased affordability.âHome prices should soften up after the spring when there is less competition.âThanks for tuning in again, I hope this information will be helpful to you when youâre buying or selling in Marysville. Please consider me your #1 resource for real estate!",
