<p>Today I have a good story about how I helped some buyers get a home for less than what they were willing to pay.</p>

<p>This particular couple needed a home where they could have a shorter commute to work, and after looking at about 20 homes, we found one that they fell in love with. Because they wanted it so badly, we crafted an offer that was above full price and also put in an escalation clause.
<a href="https://twitter.com/home/?status=An escalation clause will surely strengthen your offer.%20http://sandyandcompanyvideos.com/how-can-escalation-clause-help-you.html%20via%40" target="_blank" class="pullquote">âAn escalation clause will surely strengthen your offer.â</a>
An escalation clause means that we were willing to pay slightly above everyone elseâs offer, up to a certain amount.</p>

<p>This made our offer seem very strong and very urgent, and it ended up working! Early the next morning the sellers told us that they would take our offer without even waiting to see what others would offer. They named us a price, which was actually a bit below what we were willing to pay in the escalation clause, and we matched the offer.</p>

<p>This just goes to show how important it is to craft a good offer in a competitive market, such as the one that we have here in Puget Sound.</p>

And thatâs what I like about her, and she tells you up front what it is, whatâs going on, how itâs going to happen. Iâve bought houses before and itâs never been this easy.

The builder made a commitment to us that he later reneged on and she took it upon herself to write a request explaining our particular difficult situation that he would reconsider. And they did try to reconsider and do what they could to help us out. I donât think that would have happened if she hadnât stuck her neck out for us.â</p>

When she listed it I signed the papers and two seconds later the sign went up and about an hour and a half later I canât even begin to tell you how many agents walked in with their clients. That was on a Thursday and we had all the offers that we needed by Saturday. What more can I say. I was hysterical because I didnât expect it to happen that fast. She was very calming to me because I really was [hysterical]. I thought Iâd have a couple weeks or something, I didnât expect to have an offer in two days. She not only calmed me, she had an open house.  You know I was saying letâs forget the open house and she said no, this can make the difference between the listing price or less. So I said okay, fine. In order to prep the house she had equipment that I could borrow that was so very necessary such as a power washer, a rug cleaner. This woman is on the ball. I will tell you at the close of sale things went a little screwy and she knocked herself to make things right for me. I canât praise her enough.</p>

I did a lot of the selling of the home, the short sale, without my husband, I mean because he was so busy, but they handled my stress. Every question, she was right there. She was like, Iâll show it, get the house and get all the paperwork [ready] donât worry.  That was above and beyond. A lot of people think oh theyâre doing a short sale, no big thing.

		            <p class="testimonial">âWe had been trying to sell our house with a different agent. [Then] we got Sandy. Very much of a go getter and which was appreciated because my husband and I didnât have a whole lot of time to set up things like open houses and what not. I mean she did a lot of work setting up open houses and marketing it. [She] had a great photographer come in. If something needed to be checked at the house, my husband and I were both out of the house for a time, and sometimes weâd need a quick turnaround on looking at something and we wouldnât be able to make it up and so sheâd actually go over and handle it. Like I think there were a couple times she took the garbage can down from the road. Which I wasnât even expecting her to do that. But that was fantastic.&nbsp; We had a question of the square footage and she actually went over and measured the whole house and you know did a quick estimate there just to do a quick sanity check. So that was really good.â</p>

Getting it repaired, she actually supplied us with a moving truck and couple of strong guys to help us move since we got behind the 8-ball between the buyers of our old house and getting into our new house. I mean considering all the stuff that happened it went really well. I mean there was a lot of things that got in the way, a lot of circumstantial stuff that doesnât normally happen in the process of buying and selling homes and she was working for us on the selling and the buying aspect. Considering all the stuff that tried to sidetrack us it all went really well and she kept going above and beyond to get us where we needed to be and get into the new house.</p>

And the first offer we made we didn't get any feedback and the offer was turned down. But then the second offer we got some feedback from Sandy and that feedback is what helped us get the offer. It wasn't like it was a lot of information, but it was exactly what we needed because we had no idea what we were doing. This was the first time we bought a house. The Realtor we were working with wasn't as helpful but Sandy was showing the house that we eventually bought and she gave us the right tools that we needed. Other than that she was very helpful about letting us know on a day-to-day basis, schedules and things of that nature. I almost wish she'd been our Realtor, would have been really nice.</p>
