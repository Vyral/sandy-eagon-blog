Fall can be a really exciting time. The leaves start turning, the air gets crisp, and the holidays are just around the corner. When everything is groovy around you — the roof over your head is solid and your cupboards are full — it’s easy to think of the fall as a harvest time, a time of ample supply. Unfortunately, that is not the case for everyone.

In the Marysville community, we have a large population of people who are either hungry or on the verge of hunger. This is true in every community, including Everett, Stanwood, and Lake Stevens. Jesus said that the poor will always be with you, but we don’t want them to be the same people all the time. It’s really important to make sure that we do what we can as the hands and the feet of Jesus, caring for our neighbors.

Jesus also said that when you give out a cup of water in His name, you are giving it to Him. We need to help our communities in tangible ways. October is the food drive month for Realtors, and that’s why I’m sending you this. If you can, please drop off food or cash donations to our office and we will deliver them to the Marysville Food Bank. I can even swing by and pick up your donations from you.

If you are not from Marysville but would like to support the food bank, let me know. I can put you in touch with someone either in Marysville or in your own community. Remember, it’s important to give where you live.
“Let’s be good neighbors to each other.”
One reason the food bank is so near to my heart is that when I was a child, we often got those baskets of food. We got the commodity cheese, powdered scrambled eggs, and powdered milk from the government. I didn’t even like real milk when I first tried it because I wasn’t used to it. It’s very important to me that when I am experiencing abundance that I give back as well. Please help us be a resource for others.

If you are on the other side of this — if you are struggling right now, please let me know. I can put you in touch with someone who can help you. The Everett Gospel Mission not only helps people with housing, they will also give you a bag of food. They even have a little store that you can walk through complete with household items, clothes, and food that you can have for free.

So this fall, let’s be good neighbors to each other. If you are my neighbor and you need help, please open up. I am here to help you. At Keller Williams, we are a team. TEAM stands for Together Everyone Achieves More. Let’s work together to put food on the table for our neighbors and make our community a great place to live.

Again, if you have any donations for our food bank, just drop them off at our office at 1027 State Ave #102 in Marysville. If you can’t make the trip, let me know and I will collect the donations for you. I look forward to hearing from you!

Today I wanted to tell you a story about a Baby Boomer buyer we just helped downsize and why she’s so excited about her brand new home in her retirement years.

I got a call from a lender with a client who was very stressed out–she had a nearly 4,000 sq. ft. house with three living spaces and a huge garage. It was an older brick home that needed some paint and just some all-around love. The payment was also huge, nearly $4,000. It was just too much.

She has been working hard all her life and is coming up on retirement. She was also having a hard time making ends meet because of this monstrous payment and all the maintenance required. So my lender spoke with her about her whole financial situation and found that she was in a position to buy a reverse mortgage.

Now, a reverse mortgage is not for everyone and there are some important criteria to consider, so I’ll refer you to my lender for that conversation if it’s one you want to have.
“Where are you in the cycle of your home life?”
With the reverse mortgage, our buyer was able to put down a significant chunk for a down payment, and now she’s not going to have a payment for the rest of time she lives in her home. All she has to do is maintain her insurance, taxes, and the home itself.

When looking at houses, she needed something with separate spaces for both herself and her adult son who lived with her. We were able to find her a split-level home where he has the lower level and she has the upstairs, and the home is much newer than her previous home. It’s perfect for them.

And this was the very first house we looked at. We looked at a couple others, but the first house ended up being her perfect home. It really does happen once in a while. We’re getting her previous home ready for the market, and we know it will be perfect for someone needing more space.

If you’re looking into your retirement years and you’re thinking about your house and your mortgage, I’d love to talk with you about it. The question is this–where are you in the cycle of your home life? Give me a call or send me an email and we’ll talk soon.

It is a tough market out there for buyers right now and it’s important that you work with the right agent. Our team works hard to help buyers win in this market, and you should make sure you work with an agent who knows how to compete with other offers.

Last weekend, I was doing an open house for one of my sellers. It was a hot listing that went on the market Wednesday and by Saturday, we already had a full-price offer in place. However, we still held open houses that weekend because we had already said we would wait to review offers that Monday.

One of the buyers who walked in had seen our advertising and really wanted to check out the home. However, they were also bummed because they had just lost out on a house. I said, “I know, it’s a pretty tough market out there. We’re doing a lot of escalation clauses.” I mentioned a few other things we do to help our buyers get ahead in the current market, and they just said, “What’s that?”

Their reaction really gave me pause because we talk about how we can help our buyers win so frequently that it just becomes an automatic part of our process. There are tools you can use to make your offer better than someone else’s and there are ways to put your best offer forward. You don’t have to max out your budget right away; you can start out softer so that you are able to get stronger down the line, and we can help you get that house.
“We have tools and strategies to help buyers win in this tough market.”
I took the time to educate this buyer, which still benefits my seller. “Let’s say we have a full-price offer. Here is how you might craft your offer to get the home.” They hadn’t heard any of these strategies before. But they still thought it didn’t matter because the main problem was the seller probably wouldn’t pay the closing costs. My answer? “That’s no problem at all!”

Most sellers are willing to pay closing costs, especially if they get the price they want for the house. I gave them a few different points to make their offer better. They went back to their own agent and wrote their own offer. The agent called me the next day with some questions. The buyer wound up getting the house for $15,000 less than their max and my seller was able to get $5,000 more than they expected, even after paying the buyers’ closing costs.

We can make this happen for you. Don’t assume that just because your agent is part of a big team means they will know, understand and use all of the strategies necessary to win in this tough market. Talk to your agent about what happens when you’re in a bidding war. If you’re not sure what questions to ask them, give me a call and I can help you out.

If you have any other real estate questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you!

If you’re an investor looking to sell a property you didn’t live in and avoid paying the capital gains tax on the sale, you need to think about using a tax deferred exchange. That means, basically, rolling the profit you’d make from that sale directly into your next purchase.

In our market, it’s the perfect time to sell. Is it the perfect time to buy for an investment property, though?

Let’s say you sell a 1,500 square foot house and buy a 2,500 square foot house. Then, let’s say you sold that slightly bigger house and bought a duplex. With those three purchases, you’re getting a bigger investment and putting your equity to work for you by having your tenants pay rent, and still not paying any capital gains tax. You’re delaying paying any meaningful taxes until further down the road when you’re not in your strongest income years.
“If you’re an investor, you need to think about using a tax deferred exchange.”
The question, then, isn’t whether investing in real estate is a good idea, but how to do it in a savvy manner. I have no problem paying taxes; I just don’t plan to be paying more than I need to.

If any of this interests you, reach out to me by giving me a call or sending me an email. I’m excited to hear from you!

        <title>How a $10 Wax Ring Could Save You $10,000</title>

What do you know about the wax rings on toilets? It’s a very sexy topic, I know.

I recently had two different clients whose inspectors found leaking toilets. In fact, one of the leaks had spread underneath both the bathtub and the surrounding ceramic tile floor. And the seller refused to handle that repair, so my buyer inherited this problem.

This turned out to be a $10,000 repair job!

Do you know how much a new wax ring around that toilet would have cost? About $8. If that seller had replaced the wax ring when needed, the entire $10,000 repair job could have disappeared. Good thing my buyer is planning to do some remodeling in the future, but he still had to spend $2,500 to repair just the minimum damage.
“Wouldn’t you spend $8 to save $10,000?”
So this led me to do some research on toilet maintenance (yeah, it’s a glamorous job being your Realtor resource!). After all, it’s hard to notice a leak when it’s under ceramic tile. What I found is that a properly installed wax ring should protect for 10 to 20 years. So even if all seems well but it has been 10 or 12 years, pick a day. Drain the toilet and replace the wax ring, because it doesn’t cost much at all.

And do it right! Failing to install a wax ring properly can be just as expensive as having it fail on its own. Further, it can also cause dangerous sewer gas to enter your home.That ring connects the toilet to the floor, acting like a caulking that keeps water and sewer gas from leaking out. But even if you want to hire a professional to ensure it’s done completely correctly, it will only cost you a couple hundred bucks, instead of $10,000!  It’s not worth the risk!

If you notice any issue with your floor, take care of it quickly. $8? or $10,000? I know which one I’d rather leave in my pocket.

If you have more questions, please feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!

Legal deadlines are one of the most important facets of real estate, so it’s important to have the help of your real estate expert with you all along the way.

In a perfect world, you sign a contract and in 30 days, the buyer has the keys. This is a really complicated transaction though, with legal and physical issues, lender criteria, and much more in between. It’s our job to understand this process so we can assure your success down the road.

We track when your loan gets out of the underwriting process, so you have time to sign disclosures and have the correct documents reviewed. There may also be agreed-upon repairs to inspect prior to closing. Sometimes these repairs aren’t done to the buyer’s satisfaction, which can cause a lot of heartache and delay.

We deal with the appraiser who may expect things to be done a certain way as well. Appraisers can’t simply take our word that repairs were done right on the home - they re-inspect as well. Many things happen in 30 to 45 days, and much gets pushed into the last two weeks.
“We’ll make sure you have a Plan A, B, and C to achieve your real estate goals.”
Both buyers and sellers have other issues going on in their lives, which also complicates matters. For instance, the seller may be buying a new home too, and they’re being held accountable to their seller to get the funds for their closing. If they can’t close on the home you’re buying, they may not be able to close in time on their next home. It’s extremely stressful. Consider services like a moving truck as well: many are booked three weeks in advance, and can’t accommodate changes on two days’ notice.

My job as a consultant is to talk with you about all these different issues and to ensure that you’re prepared for Plan B and maybe even Plan C. We want to make sure that if we don’t take the exact path we planned on taking at the beginning, we still get you to your destination.

If you have any questions about the real estate process or you’re thinking about buying or selling a home in Puget Sound, give me a call today. Make it a great day!

When homeowners are going to build or remodel something in their home, do they really need a permit? It might seem tempting to just skip this step, but as you’ll see, it can have some horrendous consequences.

A client of mine is currently buying a home here in Washington. However, he needs to sell his home in Alaska first. Things were going just great until he found out that there was a problem with the garage he had built behind his Alaska home. The county found that the garage was built three feet into the setback from the property line. He had to go in front of the zoning board to ask for a variance to be able to sell his property with the garage. They said no.

Now the owner has to take three feet off his garage, and that involves removing the stairs, the roof, and changing the foundation.
“It’s important to consider all the possible consequences.”
He thought he was making the right move because he was very handy and knew how to build a garage. What he did not take into account was that he needed a permit. If he would have spent the $100 or so to get the permit, he could have discovered the setback and updated his building plans accordingly.

Now it is going to cost him more than $18,000 to remove three feet from the corner of his garage. We’re confident that we’ll be able to find a solution in the end, but the transaction is a hot mess right now. He’s wishing he got that permit right about now, and you would too if this happened to you.

So, when you’re considering a remodel or home improvement project, ask yourself what the possible consequences could be. If they’re anywhere near the trouble that this seller had to go through, go ahead and get a permit. It will save you much more in the long run.

UPDATE: As it turns out, this my client had originally gotten the permit for his garage. However, he changed the project plans after getting the permit and did not check with the county. He wanted the lines of the garage to match his house instead of the property line. So he turned the garage, and that’s when the corner of the garage pushed into that setback.

Since he didn’t follow up with anyone about his permit after changing the plans, he’s dealing with a lot of heartache along with the almost $20,000. He lost his Alaska buyer and the Washington home he was hoping to move into.

This is still a lesson in not only acquiring a permit, but following a permit closely.

If you have any questions for me don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I would love to hear from you!

        <description>Clients and friends,

I have an important update for you about the value of your home.

If you’ve been following the news, the Federal Reserve is likely to raise interest rates when they meet on June 15th.

It’s been all over the news these past few weeks.


Why the Federal Reserve has to raise interest rates
This makes it more expensive for people to own a home by raising their mortgage payments.

It also decreases your pool of buyers thus lowering your home value.

Further, after a 6-year record run up in home prices since the 2008-2009 recession, this may be the last year to get the maximum price on your home sale.

It’s likely we’ll see a market correction next year.

We’re still seeing neighborhoods with very tight inventory. This means if you list your home for sale, it will sell quickly and in many neighborhoods above asking price.

I write you because this summer is the best year to sell your home to get the maximum price.

If you are thinking about selling your home, I have a special gift for you…

It’s the latest housing data from the market. It will give you a good guideline of where the market is going but at the end of the day, the best way to get up-to-date information about the market is by speaking with an expert, like the members of our team.

You can find out what your home is worth right now based on your neighbor’s recent home sale price.

Want to know what your home would sell for today?

Enter your home address here to learn what price your home is worth.

With a short visit to your home, I’ll fill you in on what price it will sell for today at no charge.

We’ve worked with many home buyers recently and know exactly what people are looking for in the hottest homes.

My estimates are right on the money.

And not to worry - if you’re thinking about buying a new home, I’ll share with you the neighborhoods where home prices are now more affordable.

You may be able to live in a nicer area you previously thought unaffordable.

I can also help you secure a low, fixed rate mortgage without junk fees with a minimal down payment.

I’ll put you in touch with my best preferred lenders.

Anyway, I write you since we’re wrapping up one of the hottest home selling seasons ever.

Our economy is normalizing, interest rates are rising, and pent-up demand following the 2008-2009 recession is less. This is the summer to sell your home.

So, I invite you to find out what your home will sell for. It’s free to you.

You can also email or call me at (425) 422-7372 or &#083;&#097;&#110;&#100;&#121;&#064;&#083;&#097;&#110;&#100;&#121;&#065;&#110;&#100;&#067;&#111;&#109;&#112;&#097;&#110;&#121;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;. I’m happy to answer any questions you have about real estate.

If you’re in the Puget Sound area and haven’t been able to sell your home in the last few years because your value isn’t quite where you want it to be, we’ve got some great information to share with you.

A homeowner reached out to me about a month and a half ago. They had tried to sell last year, but they owed more than their market value. When they’d bought, they needed all 3200 square feet: they had three children at home and were holding church services in their bonus room. But now it was time to downsize, both for size and money. The husband had just changed jobs and travels a lot, so they weren’t even sure whether Snohomish County was where they wanted to be. Two of the three children are moving out in the fall. Their budget was stretched, the market is peaking, and they knew it was time to sell.
“You can accomplish your selling goals in today’s market.”
After looking at the home, we decided that if the home was going to sell, this was the market to do it in. We did our full marketing blitz, including personally inviting the neighbors to our open house that had about 30 buyers go through. We really pushed the top of the market with our price, and we were hoping for one or two good offers. We had several people come through multiple times, and the right buyer showed up.

We secured a full-price offer for our sellers, and the home sale just closed. This family decided to rent so they have the flexibility to decide where they want to settle in the next year. They have 1,500 less square feet to clean, pay $1,000 less per month on their rent, and they accomplished all of this in today’s market.

We are at the peak of the market, the growth is slowing. There’s a shift coming up, so your top window of opportunity in this market is closing. Who do you know who we can help with our expert service and proven systems to get top dollar?

If you or someone you know has been wondering whether it’s the right time to sell, we would be happy to talk to you. Just give us a call or send us an email and we’ll be in touch!

Our real estate market has been wildly hot for the past few years. It’s even been so good that some people think we’d made another bubble, but we’re starting to see some of that growth slow down. Between January 2015 to 2016, we experienced 11% growth in our market. That is pretty typical from what we have been seeing, but from month to month after January, we have seen that growth trickle slowly down to 8%.

What does this mean for you? If you’re thinking of selling, you may want to do so soon. Prices are still rising, and they certainly won’t be falling, but you may be better off selling your home right now. Most people look to the past to predict their outcome, but I have to look towards the future for you, and our market is slowing down.
“Market growth is slowing, but that doesn’t mean it’s a bad time to buy or sell.”
I can’t tell you what the future will be like, but I can tell you that growth is slowing for right now. This doesn’t mean you need to rush to get your home on the market, but it’s a good idea to step in sooner than later.

If you’re buying, this slowing is helping you. Remember that interest rates are still very low. This is why you need to call me and discuss all the factors in our market that affect your home search. Give me a call today!

We’re seeing a very small amount of homes available in Puget Sound, and demand is sky-high right now. There is less than a month’s supply of homes! That means we’re operating in a heavy seller’s market. If no new homes come on the market in the next 27 days, we would be left without any homes to buy or sell.

So, what does this mean for buyers in Puget Sound? You’ll have to fight other buyers if you find a home that you like. On a recent showing with a buyer, we encountered another buyer completing an inspection even before they made an offer on the home. Of the five offers the agent received, four out of these five families opted to get pre-inspections done. Traditionally, this inspection happens after a seller accepts a buyer’s offer. This means that the other three families just spent $300-$400 on an inspection, and they didn’t even win the house.
“Your home will sell before you can bat an eye.”
So what advice are we giving buyers? We recommend that you don’t fall in love with a home when you walk in. Be realistic - this market is crazy and you might just have a home swept out from under you by a buyer that’s even more eager than you. If you’ve fallen in love and lost the home, then you will have a hard time acting when you have another opportunity. Also, you’re going to have to make some sacrifices if you want your dream home. Size, money, or finishes- you’re either paying more or getting less.

However, we have just helped two buyers win bidding wars on homes, so it is possible and we know how to win over sellers.

For sellers in Puget Sound, we have one simple question; what are you waiting for? Get your home on the market immediately if you want to sell! Your home will sell before you bat an eye.

If you’re looking to buy or sell in Puget Sound, please don’t hesitate to contact me. You deserve an expert at your side to navigate you through this tough market!

        <description>

I’m here recounting my interview with Sylvia Anderson. Unfortunately, we experienced some technical difficulties during recording, so I want to recreate it for you. The last portion of our talk focused on the challenging position of her team, including helping people in crisis and supporting them.

I asked Sylvia how she keeps strong for her clients. She has to keep herself refreshed, or she gives out stale water, she said. One way is that when she’s off the grounds she leaves her work at the office.

Since we’d been talking about how they make it clear to their clients that they’re the same, I wondered how transparent are they with clients? “We have to be careful because clients are in their own crisis, and if we share our current crisis, then they jump on board to solve our issues. It’s a welcome but unhealthy diversion, so we only share situations that we’ve come through and had victory in or have learned lessons from.”
“Everyone needs a support system.”
Current staff struggles are saved for sharing outside the EGM circle. Sylvia continued that everyone needs to have a support system of two people in their lives; one we can let see us in our weakness and another who can be a truth teller, who has permission to take us aside and share a hard truth we need to hear.

So to give back, I wanted to show you how you can learn more about the mission. You can go to their website at www.EGmission.org. They offer poverty awareness training, volunteering opportunities, and tours. They’re always happy to talk about their mission. There are resources for all people in the community who need help, whether they are homeless, struggling to maintain their home, or dealing with the associated struggles.

I asked Sylvia for any final thoughts. She said, “We have a responsibility to the poor. Isaiah 43 says ‘bring my sons from afar and my daughters from ends of the Earth, everyone who is called by my name who I created for my glory whom I formed and made.’ That’s what we’re doing; bringing in God’s sons and daughters, and if we’re not giving away to people who have no way to give back to us, then we’d better check our faith.”

I recently had an amazing conversation with Sylvia Anderson of the Everett Gospel Mission. We talked a lot about faith and life and although the audio was cut short, I want to share some of the things we talked about with you. This is part two of our interview.

The message Sylvia shares the first time someone walks in their door is that we can all have faith that God is there and is for us. So I asked, “What about the second or third time someone comes in? How do they believe you this time when their circumstances are the same as before?” Sylvia responded that she is so glad God doesn’t just meet her in her addictions the first time around the mountain, He is there every time. We all have addictions, and when we say that our addictions are “better” than others, we’re setting up ourselves as the judge. Put another way, her clients’ struggles are no bigger to God than her struggles.  We are all valuable and human, and she shares that message with her clients at the Everett Gospel Mission.
“Seeds take time to grow.”
After all, how many times have you dealt with something over and over, only to finally resolve the issue? Besides, when a client comes back to EGM after being back on the street, they are not the same person as before. They’ve grown and they’ve learned. If they see something happening around them that’s not right, maybe before it didn’t bother them. And now it does. That is change to be celebrated.

Sometimes seeds take a while to grow. Change doesn’t happen overnight. Sylvia was recently with a gentleman who was getting ready to sign a lease, but was hesitant– he had never signed a lease on his own. He was 50 years old! With the support of the Everett Gospel Mission, he signed that lease and is doing well.

This is just an example of the success stories that Sylvia and the Everett Gospel Mission are seeing. Every situation is different and people constantly change and grow. When you have support from family, friends, and Jesus Christ, anything is possible.

Stay tuned for part 3 of our conversation, where we will handle being emotionally supportive of the people in your life. I can’t wait to see you soon on the next step of this faith walk.

I recently had the pleasure of speaking with Sylvia Anderson, the CEO of Everett Gospel Mission. She’s been there for about 20 years. I took a few notes from our conversation and wanted to share those with you today.

First of all, a little information about Sylvia’s background. When she started working with the Everett Gospel Mission, she wasn’t quite sure what it was all about. So after eight months, she asked the board if she could stay and has been here ever since. She has two children, one adopted, and has also fostered a number of children.

When she was fostering, Sylvia didn’t realize she was training for her work with Everett Gospel Mission. There’s a strong correlation between foster care and homelessness: 40% of the homeless population has been in foster care.

Sylvia and I were talking about faith, and one of the first questions I asked her was, “How do you share faith with a group of people who may not see a lot of reason for faith?” She responded that actually, a lot of their clients have very strong faith. They get on their feet every morning searching for what they don’t see.
“The Everett Gospel Mission sees the homeless as Jesus would.”
Sylvia said, “Faith is the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen.” Sylvia gets the privilege of speaking with these people and helping them strengthen their faith that has already kept them going. They just don’t know the name behind it, so she and her staff have the opportunity to introduce them to Jesus, who has been with them and they may not have realized it.

“When we realize that the homeless are strong, valuable people, that helps alleviate judgment.”  The Everett Gospel Mission looks at people as Jesus would see them. Part of their mission is to open the eyes of the community to see the value in every person.

The Everett Gospel Mission works to build connections between the homeless and the rest of the community. When someone loses their home, they can also lose their sense of belonging. Sylvia wants to make it clear that they have a respectful, strong community of people at the Everett Gospel Mission and this is where they belong.

Sylvia and I talked for a while, so watch out for parts two and three of our discussion in the next few days. If you have any questions, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to talk with you.

Moving from one property to another is a major decision for yourself and your family. It’s difficult to tell when the right time to sell is, but you can come closer to your answer by asking yourself a few tough questions.


  Consider some of these questions:
  If you could live anywhere, where would it be?
  Why aren’t you there yet?
  If you sell in 5-10 years, will you wish that you’d sold sooner?
  Is now the time?
“Don’t wait for the market to peak to sell your home.”
If you need a professional to consult with, please don’t hesitate to contact me. This is not a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ decision, and sometimes this answer cannot come from you alone. I would be happy to consult with you to determine an appropriate time for you and your family to sell.


Keep in mind that we expect a great spring selling season, so talk to us as soon as possible if you’re interested!

Real estate transactions can be tough. You often have a lot on the line, both in thousands of dollars and in the security of your home. How can you ‘win’ what you want in a real estate transaction? It helps to determine what is most important to you. You have to ask yourself what you need to get out of a transaction.

Stress is common when making negotiations in the real estate market, and when we stress we often get stuck on the smaller details. Instead, we should focus on the bigger picture and what is really at stake in your transaction.
“Think about the big picture.”
When you worry that everything is falling apart, remember the bigger picture. Sometimes several things go wrong with the home or the negotiation. That’s when we assess how important it really is, what we can do, and whether we’ll be happy with the outcome. We don’t have to walk away or bail out because we’re scared- we move step by step to resolve, overcome, and come up with a win after the finish line.

If you have any questions about buying or selling in Puget Sound, please don’t hesitate to contact me! 2016 will be a great year to sell a home, but spring has already begun, so don’t delay.

I look forward to hearing from you!

Today, we’re talking about making our homes into places that make us smile. When I help clients, I explain how important it is to smile while walking through the front door.

In the winter, we have a tendency to hunker down. This time of year is great for focusing on interior projects, like making a quilt or painting a room.
“Your home is an extension of you.”
I’m a project person. My husband and I love projects that will make us smile when we walk into our homes. Now that spring is coming, it’s time to focus on outdoor projects. In fact, we just took a tree down in the backyard yesterday. We also went to Sunnyside Nursery, which has a great selection, and picked out some fruit trees to plant this weekend. We got dwarf apple, plum, and pear trees so we won’t have to spend the whole day out in the yard but can still enjoy the fruits of our labors.

We love to make our home our castle! My castle probably looks different from your castle, but if you’re a homeowner, you want to be able to come home and enjoy it. Your home is an extension of you. That’s why it’s crucial for your home to make you smile.

If you’re looking for a space to please you, give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you find your castle here in Puget Sound!

With spring around the corner, it’s a perfect time to go through my 5 Step Home Review and find out what your home is worth.

Today we’re talking about how you’re killing your home with kindness. I bring this up because spring is approaching and you’re probably going to be making some improvements to your home. Most of the time the work you do will improve your home, but sometimes it can actually take away from the value of your property.

Today we will discuss four different ways that you could be hurting your home instead of helping it.


  Don’t buy light bulbs that are too bright. Bright homes are good, but buying bulbs that are too powerful can be a fire hazard. Also related, I recommend incandescent bulbs for when you’re showing your home because they warm up quickly.
  Don’t plant trees near driveways and near your slab. Trees should be at least 10-20 feet away from paved areas, and this is also true for septic drainfield areas. The roots will destroy your driveway, and you don’t want a buyer to inherit this problem.
  Overzealous pressure washing. It’s easy to damage the wood on your deck or your siding by power washing it too vigorously. Be careful and use the right nozzle, or just hire a professional to do it. And stay off your roof with your pressure washer!!
  If you store firewood in your home, make sure it is cured and dried. Fresh wood will likely have dormant insects nesting in it, and when you bring it into your warm home, the bugs will leave the wood and enter your home. Only store a few pieces of dry wood at a time if you’re looking for ambiance.

Last fall we sold a very unique home- let me share. Originally listed with a different agent, the home sat on 3 acres inside Marysville, but the home was priced too high. The home and property were beautiful, but it had all the original features in it. It’s what we affectionately call vintage,requiring at least $60,000 in updating to make this home shine again.

We listed the property in the range to accommodate the repairs. We got lots of showings but everyone had a bigger number in their head for repairs, so we inched the price down just a little more. There was nothing else with acreage in-town, so we gave it a little longer and kept holding open houses. Within a few days, we got two full price offers and then a third offer willing to pay $5,000 above what anyone else put down.
“We got two full price offers and then a third offer willing to pay $5,000 above what anyone else put down.”
When it was all said and done, we had three different offers resulting in $13,000 above the listed price. This was only days before we thought we were going to have to reduce the price!

So, what happened? We were patient and the market responded. We used all our marketing avenues, and the buyers who fell in love originally found us through our open house.

If you have a unique home to sell in Puget Sound, please don’t hesitate to contact us. It’s going to be a great year to sell a home!

About a year and a half ago, a couple reached out to me online. They were looking for a home that fit them and their three large dogs and property with breathing room between them and neighbors. We looked for about a year, but nothing worked perfectly. Then their landlord told them that he was selling the rental they lived in. Urgency kicked in- they needed a home that they could count on rather than try to find another landlord who would allow their dogs.

We found them a great house next to forestry land- country living and trails through the the forestry acres to walk the dogs. But the night we all came to agreement, a windstorm knocked three trees into the house.

I communicated with the listing agent regularly and then the contractor to see how work was going. Unfortunately, after two months, we realized we were no closer to work starting on the home and needed to keep looking.
“We work hard to find security for our buyers.”
Keeping this contract in place as a back-up, we chose a rambler that was perfect for their needs. It was more money, and it had a long honey-do list that came with it, but the home and property worked better for my clients than the “tree-house.” We helped them get bids on a couple of the projects to make sure they weren’t biting off more than they could chew. And our lender handled their financing which was a little tricky. After we’d cleared all the obstacles on this perfect home, we let the first house go.

Now our friends are securely in their own home with elbow room that they’ll treasure for many years to come.

We work hard to find security for our buyers so that they have a plan B should their initial plan fall through. The beauty is that sometimes Plan B turns out even better than Plan A. It’s worked for our other clients, and we’d love to make it work for you!

If you have any real estate questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We would love to hear from you!

“Sandy is one of the most positive, upbeat, motivated, caring and just plain nice people I have ever worked with.  I believe she is actually interested in helping improve the lives of each and every client that is lucky enough to have come in contact with her.

We had a unique situation with pretty specific needs in finding the right house.   We searched and searched with Sandy and her team, looking at house after house.  We looked at so many I was worried about Sandy giving up on us.  She never did at all.  We finally found “the house” and Sandy negotiated a great deal for us.  The very night we signed the agreement the winds came up and blew not one but three trees down on the house destroying much of the upper level.  Sandy was out there with us every step again and when it became apparent the repair project would not meet our time frame needs, it was off to look at more houses.  I just knew now she had to be sick of us and would send us on our way to find another agent, but not a chance.  With the same care and energy from day one she set out to find us a great home.  After many more appointments and miles and miles of travel for Sandy and her team, we found an even better home in a beautiful location with plenty of room and trees to enjoy for years to come.  I am amazed that Sandy always had the same big smile and enthusiasm at each property we viewed and I believe that that through all this journey to find our home we were so very lucky to have come across Sandy Eagon.”  - John.

We’ve been working throughout the surrounding Puget Sound area and the market is the same in every county! There are hardly any houses for sale. Instead of talking about inventory in terms of months, now we’re talking about it in terms of weeks: we have about five to seven weeks of inventory. If nothing new came on for sale, that’s how long it’d take to sell every house in our MLS.
“There’s next to no inventory!”
If you have a property priced right and in good condition, it can sell in two days! This urgency gives sellers so much power and buyers especially need to be conscious of this.

If you’re looking to buy, let’s have a conversation and see what the best fit is.

Today, we’re talking about walking out our purpose. I want to work on dealing with my emotions in a way that practices my faith. Our emotions affect so much of what happens in our day and how we treat other people.

I’d like to share a conversation I had with my coach, Chris, about how to get to that next level. Here’s what I took back.

“There’s a teaching that says, ‘We can’t control the first thought, but we can control the second thought, and the third.’ It’s like putting yourself on a mental diet. You have to ask, ‘Do I really want to allow those negative thoughts?’
“You have to exercise your faith muscle.”
“You have to exercise your faith muscle. There are all kinds of levels of [physical] fitness, and for some people, just being able to move more in a general, active way is more fit than they were, especially for people overcoming health issues. Just being able to be mobile is huge, so how can we judge ourselves based on one person to the other?”

You can listen to the full conversation here. I would love to hear your thoughts. If there’s anything you can share or learn from each other to get us out of that rut of how we’ve always worked, please reach out to me. Let’s be purposeful in our lives and be that person we’re meant and created to be. I look forward to hearing from you!

One of the biggest misconceptions out there is that the winter is a bad time to sell a home. Today, I have three reasons this couldn’t be further from the truth:


  
    You have less competition in January. March and April are when inventory starts to increase. When buyers have more options, you are less likely to sell your home quickly and for top dollar. Listing now is a great way to avoid getting lost in the crowd.
  
  
    Winter buyers are more motivated. In our part of the country, we get a lot of rain, wind, and sometimes snow in the winter. And yet, we still have people purchasing homes! This happens because there are always people that need to make a move in the next 30 days. The people out looking now are extremely serious about buying a home soon.
  
  
    Your competition doesn’t look perfect right now either. There aren’t many homes on the market right now, and the ones that are don’t look as good right now as they will later. Take advantage of this by making your home look spectacular right now!
“Many people mistakenly believe that the winter is a bad time to sell.”
If you’re looking to sell your home quickly and for top dollar, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I would love to help you make informed decisions in today’s market!

Recently, a client had to move out of town before they sold their property. They needed someone here in Puget Sound to manage the home sale, and we were happy to fulfill their need.

We marketed their home aggressively in many ways, including knocking on doors to let neighbors know about the new listing.

It was a nice ranch-style rambler with a three-car garage and an open back yard. When we held an open house, several neighbors came through and we ended up getting three offers on the property! We negotiated and accepted the best offer for our client.

That very night, the house was broken into. Fortunately a neighbor noticed and called us- we called our client and then the police immediately. Whoever broke in had started setting up a drug operation. We cleaned up the house, posted signs that the house was being watched and instructed the neighbors to call 911 immediately and us second this time. No need, our prompt response let the drug makers know they should go elsewhere.
“We took care of everything for our client.”
After this happened, we coordinated with the police to make sure that only certain people were allowed in the home. The neighbors kept a great eye on the house, and we had a lot of conversations to make sure everyone was safe.

That is one downside to vacant homes. Unfortunately, they are vulnerable to break-ins. Luckily, we were here to repair the damage and make a plan to prevent further incidents.

We moved smoothly to closing until the last weekend. They seller’s car broke down so he couldn’t get here to finish the final clean up and dump runs. We had promised the buyer in the contract that the house would be clean and ready. So my team hired a handyman service to haul everything out and leave the home tidy.

After the house sold, our client was able to make an offer on a new house in Spokane. The agent we set him up with got him ready to go with his new home.

We have a hands-on approach to real estate. If you know anyone who is thinking of buying or selling a home, please call or email us for an introduction. As always, if you have any real estate questions, give us a call or send us an email.

We look forward to hearing from you!

In my tool shed at home, I made some additions and improvements. I’d like to share them with you today.

Recently, I added a pegboard space to organize tools in my shed. I picked it out at a local hardware store. With saws, we were able to cut it to fit the size of our wall.

Recently, we sold a pretty unique property for a seller of ours, and today we’re talking about what we did to sell that home quickly and for top dollar. I got a call this summer from a colleague in the lending field who was ready to sell his home.

They had 5 acres, complete with a huge shop, apartment, barn, and private lakefront in a quiet area of Arlington. It was an awesome property, and there were quite a few agents competing for their listing. I put my best foot forward, told them I would earn their business, and showed them how. When they trusted me to list their home, we put together a game plan to make it happen.

The first part of the plan was marketing. We posted the listing on all of the online portals we usually do, with the addition of some specific sites where we knew the horse owners would be looking.

Since we know 70% of homes get sold through the local MLS, we had to make sure the agents out there knew exactly all we had here. We invited them to an open house for brokers, where we toured them through the great big shop and barn on the property.

“We ended up getting 2 full-price offers for the home.”
We had four strong buyer candidates in just the first weekend. None of them needed everything, so one by one the buyers started pulling out. But we knew the value was there. We continued marketing the property and each week we added another piece to get some extra exposure.

Sure enough, we had a buyer come in from out of town who was looking for a lakefront property. They came out and looked, and we started negotiating from there. Then another buyer who had looked and been asking questions offered, and we ended up getting 2 full-price offers for the home. Ultimately, we sold it to the out of town buyer, and ended up delivering a nice profit check to our sellers.

If you are looking for someone to sell your home who takes the time to understand your unique situation and use it to your advantage when marketing the property, we would love to sit down with you and talk about how we can get you the most amount of money in your pocket today.

If you have any questions for us, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you!

Today I want to show you a brief snippet of a longer interview that I did with Pastor Chris Manginelli. You can find the full interview here.

A lot of us want instantaneous gratification, and God doesn’t always grant that. He rewards those who diligently seek him. You have to learn how to hear him and how to respond to him. To those who sincerely seek him, you will find him.
“God rewards those who diligently seek him.”
Even when life gets tough and dark, remember that life is seasonal and that God is always there for us. If you persevere, you will find God.

Once again, if you’d like to hear the full interview, you can listen to it here.

I hope that you find value in this. If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to contact me!

Today, we’re talking about our current market. Right now, our market is shifting, so you definitely need to hear this.

Last week, for the first time in a long time, an appraisal came back where the appraiser did not give the full value of what the buyer and seller had agreed upon.

We were representing the seller, and we were pushing to sell for the highest amount we could. We contested some points of the appraisal, but ultimately, the appraisal stood. What that tells me is our market is definitely stabilizing, so sellers can’t reach that higher ground now. My broker even told me that if our listings had not sold, we need to make a 10% price drop.

The good news is that we don’t have any listings that haven’t sold, but this is just another sign that the shift I’ve been talking about for the last couple months is happening now.
“”
What does this shift mean? What do I need to do for my clients? Basically, I can report on the market and let you know how you can be successful. For sellers, this means we need to be a bit more conservative. We will have open conversations about what you can expect, and how you can get top dollar in this market.

The market is warming up to buyers. This gives buyers confidence, so we need to make sure your home is priced correctly as the market continues to slide. If you’re thinking about selling, now is the time to do so.

Buyers may lose confidence as prices go down, but with low interest rates, now is the time to buy. What you can afford to purchase will be better now than it will be next year, when we’re looking at higher interest rates. I’m actually purchasing myself because right now, buyers can afford a better house for a lower monthly payment. If you’re buying now, have confidence. You’ve made a great decision!

If you’re making a decision about buying or selling, sit down and talk with me about your specific situation. I can figure out a way to make your home dreams come true.

If you have any questions, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!

We have a lot of professionals who ask us about handling short sale situations, particularly when their clients are in distress mode and need to sell.

For example, a couple of years ago, an agent wanted to partner with us in selling their client’s house because we could negotiate the short sale. It was a long road for that client.

Last February, we made it all the way to closing, but the buyer never sent in their money. That meant we had to relist the home. We got another offer fairly quickly. We were told that this buyer was making a cash offer, but then we got a call from a lender asking for certain documentation before they would send us the money.
“We will do everything we can to make the closing happen!”
A lot of people wanted to fire the buyer. We had to deal with the escrow people, the mortgage holders, and the lender. However, this seller deserved a close. As the professionals, we wanted to do everything in our power to make this closing happen. We were able to get everybody on board, and we had a closing right on time!

So here’s my question to you: Who do you know right now who is looking for a real estate professional who will make a sale happen for them? Whether they have equity on the home or not, we will work every angle to get that job done. Give us a call or send us an email. We would love to guide you!

Sellers will commonly ask me whether they should get an entire new roof or can they  just put a second layer of composition shingles on top. Putting an entire new roof on a home is expensive, so this is a very important question.

“If you skimp on your roof, buyers will think you’ve skimped in other places”
If you have composition shingles on your roof, you can either replace sections of it, replace all of it, or put a new layer over the old layer, but this depends on multiple factors. One way to tell if you need to remove the old before putting on the new is to look at the edges of the roof and up in your attic crawlspace. If you can see rot or damage on the plywood sheeting, you should remove and replace it along with the new layer of shingles.

It’s important to keep in mind that cutting corners like  covering up rotten plywood will send messages to the buyer that you’ve been cutting a lot of corners and covering up problems elsewhere in your home. When it comes to something as important as your roof, it’s best to do the job right.

If you have any more questions or concerns about this issue, please don’t hesitate to contact me. I look forward to speaking with you!

Where is the Puget Sound market heading? Today I’ll explain how conditions are changing in our area and what it means for you!

Right now, there is a tiny bit less urgency for buyers in our market. They have a little more time to take a good look at homes before making a quick decision. Inventory isn’t moving as swiftly as it once was, showing that our market has finally cooled off a bit.
“Now is a wonderful time to be a seller!”
In March, we had an inventory of 1.3 months’ supply. This means that if no other homes were listed, in just over a month all available homes would be sold. When the market was that hot, buyers had to scramble and act quickly if they were going to get the right house. Since then, inventory has built slowly to where we are now, at 1.8 months’ supply. Although it doesn’t seem like much difference, it does allow our buyers to put their best foot forward after thinking about it for more than 5 minutes.

For sellers, we’re still getting full-priced offers in competitive situations. However, the offers aren’t coming in quite as quickly as they were earlier this summer. Nonetheless, homes are selling quickly and for top dollar, so now is a great time to sell!

If you have any questions about how you can make this market work for you, don’t hesitate- reach out to me. I would love to hear from you!

Waiting on the Lord is an evolving experience. When I have an obstacle or issue, I start to worry. When things don’t happen right, that’s where my worry kicks in.

I have noticed that my approach is different when observing others. I recently had a coworker who got very worried, upset, and anxious, and I was thinking to myself, “Why are they so upset? Don’t they know it’s just work, and it will be over at 5pm?” Then it hit me. It doesn’t really matter why it bothers him, it just does.

When I sat back and reflected on this, it allowed me to realize that, looking in, if I could detach myself emotionally from the situation, I can take away the emotional response and look at things more objectively. Then I can rely on my faith and trust in the Lord that things will be alright.
“God provides for me, but sometimes I forget this.”
God provides for me, but sometimes I forget this. This has happened to all of us; we forget to remember him. It’s not remembering in the mental sense, it’s kind of a sensory recall where you put yourself in a situation where the Lord has previously delivered you. For me, I try to remember that God brought me out of the wilderness of 2007 and 2008, and I’m here and better off for it.

I have found that I have more peace and understanding that all will be well, both in my heart and my head, when I trust in the Lord. I do this by having a constant relationship with Him, and making sure He knows all my fears, struggles, and aspirations, so He can help me make them a reality.

If you have any questions for me, or would like to discuss how you deal with impatience or anxiety, give me a call or send me an email. I would love to chat, and am always here to be there for you.

As you may know, we like to share our tools with our clients. We call it Sandy’s Tool Shed! Any of our clients are able to use them, and we have two more tools available in our shed.

First is a pressure washer, which can be really useful for improving your curb appeal and maintaining a beautiful home. Wash off the side of your home, your driveway, your patio, or any other outdoor space. My husband used it on our patio which now looks brand new! All you have to do is contact me and set up a time to come pick it up.
“New Paint can add a lot of value to your property.”
The second addition to our tool shed is a power paint sprayer. This tool takes a little bit of training, so when you borrow it, please have a good idea of how to operate it, or plan a little extra time to learn before you jump in.

A power paint sprayer can be a little tricky. And we want you to have a great experience when using our tools. After all, we like you to associate our help with great results, not with frustration! So if you feel like a power paint sprayer is a little more than you can handle, I will recommend a great painter who can do a beautiful job for you. New paint is proven to add a lot of value to a home and is important to maintain your home’s condition.

So now Sandy’s Tool Shed includes 2 extension ladders, a carpet cleaner, plumbing snake, ratchet straps for securing loads, the pressure washer and power paint sprayer, and various yard tools. As always, please feel free to contact us if you want to borrow these tools, and let us know what else you recommend we add!

Always refer to us as your #1 resource for real estate in Puget Sound!

Today I’m going to be speaking about how you can prepare to buy a home again after a major life event like a bankruptcy, foreclosure, or short sale. A lot of people are finding themselves in this situation after the market crashed in 2007. If you’re having difficulty when you’re speaking with a lender or a real estate agent, I have one important question to ask you:

What could you have done differently that in any part contributed to this painful outcome?

It’s probably not your fault that your company downsized and you lost your job, and it’s probably not your fault that the economy took a turn for the worse and housing values plummeted. However, is there something that you could have done and now could be doing differently to allow yourself to succeed? Is there a skill you need that you don’t have right now?
“You have the power to decide where your money goes and how it’s used.”
I suggest stepping back for a moment to examine where your priorities lie for yourself and your family. Even I have had to do this in my life, and I turned to certain family members and friends for advice on matters like handling my money wisely. I also took advantage of resources like www.daveramsey.com.

You have the power to decide where your money goes and how it’s used. If you have goals that are on hold and need assistance with any step of this process, please don’t hesitate to contact me!

Today I’m speaking with my coach about what we do when we are waiting for our prayers to be answered.

When something is going really wrong in your life, what do you do in the meantime? Do you pray? Do you think things over in your head?

It keeps coming back to the seeds that I plant in my life. Do you cultivate joy? Do you do the things necessary to give you peace?
“You have to take care of yourself while your prayers are being answered.”
When I get upset I work to remind myself what I need to do in order to restore my peace. In the downtime between something bad and something good, it’s important to remember what you need to do to make yourself better while you’re waiting for your prayers to be answered.

When you can do these things, you are more able to handle the tough things that happen in your life.

Thanks for watching, and I hope everyone gets something good out of this conversation!

Today I have a good story about how I helped some buyers get a home for less than what they were willing to pay.

This particular couple needed a home where they could have a shorter commute to work, and after looking at about 20 homes, we found one that they fell in love with. Because they wanted it so badly, we crafted an offer that was above full price and also put in an escalation clause.
“An escalation clause will surely strengthen your offer.”
An escalation clause means that we were willing to pay slightly above everyone else’s offer, up to a certain amount.

This made our offer seem very strong and very urgent, and it ended up working! Early the next morning the sellers told us that they would take our offer without even waiting to see what others would offer. They named us a price, which was actually a bit below what we were willing to pay in the escalation clause, and we matched the offer.

This just goes to show how important it is to craft a good offer in a competitive market, such as the one that we have here in Puget Sound.

Hey everyone, today we are going to talk about what’s going on in the Puget Sound real estate market, for buyers and sellers.

In Puget Sound, we are actually seeing interest rates bounce around a little bit. I recently spoke to a lender, who told me that last week he could quote an interest rate somewhere around 4.5%, but today, he could quote the buyer for 4.25%. With rates fluctuating, we are going to pay very close attention to them. When interest rates go up, the purchasing power of buyers decreases. Just a 1% increase in rates will cut affordability by 10%.
“Just a 1% increase in rates will cut affordability by 10%.”
We are expecting to see a bit of softening in the market by the end of the year, so sellers need to be spiffy. We are still in a hot seller’s market, but buyers are going to be more cautious and picky when choosing a home. However, if you’re looking to get value on your home sale, selling soon is ideal for you.

For buyers, sellers are still getting 98 or 99% of their asking price, so low-ball offers won’t work for the most part. However, we can give you advice on what kind of offer you can make in order to win a property.

If you have any questions for us, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon!

As we near the end of spring and begin to enter summer, I thought it would be useful to provide you with a real estate market update.

Currently, inventory is shifting a little bit, but inventory is still very, very low and buyers are squirming to find good homes. We actually only have 1.3 months of inventory right now. However, we expect a seasonal rise in inventory to help buyers find good homes. For sellers, this means that you have a very good opportunity to find a buyer willing to pay top dollar.
“The important thing to remember is to price your home correctly when you’re selling.”
Prices are still going up, but interest rates are starting to rise. For sellers, this means that you need to price your home so that many different buyers can afford your home if you want to capture the largest possible audience. Homes that are priced well and in good condition are selling very well, and sometimes even for more than the asking price. However, buyers are more savvy than they used to be and they will not overpay for homes very often unless they are really in love with a property.

The important thing to remember is to price your home correctly when you’re selling, because even though inventory is low, buyers aren’t willing to pay a whole lot extra.

Hopefully this information is useful to you if you’re planning on buying or selling a home in Puget Sound this summer. Please contact me with any questions you may have!

We’re all very busy in our lives. We have work to do, people to see, and probably a million other odds and ends that we need to accomplish. This is why today I’ll be speaking with my coach about being more purposeful in order to improve my personal life, my professional life, and my spiritual life.

One of the most important parts of being patient is slowing down enough to listen to God prompting us to go one direction or another. We like to think that we know exactly what to do, and we often do know what to do. But sometimes God is asking us to go a different direction. So, sometimes our first reactions aren’t the best ones for us, and we don’t always hear him until afterwards when it’s too late. And then we miss out on the better plans that he has for us.
“When I’m impatient and push forward, that’s when I really miss God’s best plan for me.”
I’d like to share what the Lord is working on with me right now regarding patience and listening and having a soft heart that hears and follows his direction. Hopefully this video encourages you in your walk, and I’d love to hear how he’s working in your heart as well.

If you have any comments or questions about this, please don’t hesitate to contact me and I’ll be sure to get back to you quickly.

A while back, I worked with some attorneys who ran into a sticky situation. The long story short is that they needed to sell their home quickly. The home itself was a project home with lots of repairs that needed to be done, but the owners didn’t have the time or resources to put in the necessary repairs.

We eventually listed it as a home that needed some elbow grease, and we listed it at a fair market value compared to the other fixer-uppers in the area. When we advertised it as a property that needed some love, we had every home flipper and investor in the area wanting to take a look at it.
“We know how to find serious buyers that are willing to pay top dollar for your property.”
In two days we had fifteen offers on the home! We got a full price offer in the first twenty minutes, and eventually we had an offer that was $20,000 over the asking price.

My question for you is: who do you know out there who wants to sell their home quickly and for top dollar?

We know how to find serious buyers that are willing to pay top dollar for your property. If you are looking to buy or sell anytime soon, please don’t hesitate to contact me!

Today I’ll be giving you advice on certain things you should not be doing to your home before you go to sell it, and then I’ll also give some suggestions on other things that you can do instead.

One thing that I’ve been getting questions about lately is whether or not sellers should be adding granite counter tops. My answer is always NO because multiple surveys have revealed that you don’t get your investment back when you sell your home. Instead, you can just clean your kitchen and countertops extremely thoroughly. Although it may not have the same appeal as granite, your kitchen will be spotless and will signal to the buyer that your home is in good shape.
“Repainting and putting in new carpet are pretty solid ways to add value to your home when you go to sell later on.”
Another thing you need to do is repaint the interior of your home. Pets and kids can really wreak havoc on the walls, and the same goes for carpeting. If your carpet is more than one to two years old, then I would highly suggest getting new carpet and repainting your home in light earth tones. Repainting and putting in new carpet are pretty solid ways to add value to your home when you go to sell later on.

One last thing that you might consider if you have hardwood floors is to refinish them. This can add a nice touch, and buyers will be appreciative that you went the extra step and had this done to your home.

If you don’t have the time to do these things for yourself, I know excellent contractors that can come in and get this job done quickly and efficiently.

As always, if you need assistance when you’re buying or selling in Marysville, please don’t hesitate to contact me.

Do you have a project that you’re waiting to complete because you don’t have the right tools? Depending on what you need, tools can be extremely expensive.

Luckily, I have collected some tools from my sellers, and you’re able to rent them from me as long as you sign a release. We have ladders, carpet cleaners, and more.

I recently got a hold of an extension ladder that fits in your car and stands up to twelve feet tall. You can paint vaulted ceilings or underneath your eaves. I’m happy to let you to use these items; all you have to do is contact me!
“Please let me know which tools you’re looking for- I’m gathering the equipment that people need most.”

We’re extremely fortunate here in the Pacific Northwest to have such great scenery around us. There is so much for us to do -  we have mountains, oceans, and much more.

My daughter will be turning 18 this summer, and we’ve decided that we’re going to take a Clipper Tour up to Victoria. We’re also going to be visiting Butchart Gardens while we’re there, and we’re extremely excited to be planning this trip.
“There is so much for us to do -  we have mountains, oceans, and much more.”
We’re also going to be heading to Mt. Rainier to do some camping and fishing, and I cannot wait to smell trout cooking on the campfire. I’ve always liked camping and spending time in the outdoors, and the options are limitless in our area. We’re extremely blessed to live in an area like this with so much to offer.

Another favorite day trip of mine is in Friday Harbor on San Juan Island. There is a very inexpensive ferry you can take to see the wildlife, and you can take this trip in early spring.

We would love for you to share ideas on what you do for fun in this area. We’re always looking for new adventures.

In order to prepare you for a successful spring real estate transaction, I’d like to share some information with you in the hopes that you can use it to your own advantage when you enter the real estate market.


  Home prices are rising slightly because of increased competition from spring home buyers.
  There is only a month and a half of inventory, and this is driving up prices as well.
  Home prices should soften up after the spring when there is less competition.
  With low interest rates, (sitting right around 3.75%) more buyers will be able to afford homes, and sellers will also reap the benefits of this increased affordability.
“Home prices should soften up after the spring when there is less competition.”
Thanks for tuning in again, I hope this information will be helpful to you when you’re buying or selling in Marysville. Please consider me your #1 resource for real estate!
