They were super open with us about what they were doing and what steps they were taking. And I feel like involved as really well with everything, you know, getting our feedback you you're asking us how we wanted them to negotiate. Probably a ten. I'd be super likely to recommend them"</p><p class="testimonial-author">- Peter Weiler</p><div class="client-testimonial"><p><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1151967415&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true"></iframe><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="testimonial-text">"Well, we had a lot of things going on, so we had a couple of different scenarios that could happen. Whether we were gonna do a contingency, or just buy a place without a contingency. And so it was explained to us what things could happen under both circumstances and we decided to not do a contingency and went that route because we were very well prepared. So they did a good job I guess. That was the best part I liked about Sandy and Sarah. I thought they did a great job negotiating and telling us what they thought they could get, and when my husband said "No, I don't wanna risk losing the deal." Over whatever it was that I was asking for and they said "No, you aren't going to lose the deal, so let's try this, I think we can get it." So I think we ended up getting a better deal because they're both really experienced and negotiated really well."</p><p class="testimonial-author">- Wendy</p><div class="client-testimonial"><p><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1151963113&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true"></iframe><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="testimonial-text">"She was very informative. Sandy was a complete delight. She's very professional, kept me informed about things, and I have no bad things to say about Sandy and Company."</p><p class="testimonial-author">- Elaine</p><div class="client-testimonial"><p><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1132670893&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true"></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="testimonial-text">"Well, we basically sat down with Sarah, and she gave us an information packet and verbally prepared us. It was excellent, it was perfect. No issues with communication or anything. We have a house, so the results are great."</p><p class="testimonial-author">- Vanessa</p><div class="client-testimonial"><p><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1122514381&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true"></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="testimonial-text">"Just kept in touch with us, let us know the whole time what was going on. The service was great, like I said, they kept in touch with us the whole time. If we had any questions they answered them right away, or got the answers right to me."</p><p class="testimonial-author">- Leonard</p><div class="client-testimonial"><p><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1121176849&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true"></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="testimonial-text">"I think that they assured us that they would walk us through the process, and, I talked to Sandy for lengths about different areas, before we came up from Arizona, I spoke to her on the phone and we would discuss different areas to look for homes in, and so she kind of prepared me for the market, what to expect, just different things like that. She managed our expectations very well. I thought they were right on top of it, all the time. Always willing to work with you, answers your texts and emails. Made suggestions and then followed through with whatever they need to do to make that happen. Clean process."</p><p class="testimonial-author">- Bruce and Shelley</p><div class="client-testimonial"><p><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1088150437&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true"></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="testimonial-text">"We were very happy with Sarah. Once we received Sarah she kind of stepped in and she was brilliant. She really helped us out and went the extra mile for us."</p><p class="testimonial-author">- Naomi</p><div class="client-testimonial"><p><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1080281173&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true"></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="testimonial-text">"They prepared me very well. There were a couple of different sit-down conversations just explaining the different things that were going to happen. Terms that were going to be thrown around a lot as well as just what everything was going to look like. They made it very clear. I think they are very straightforward. They fight for their clients. As well as make it clear they will never exceed your boundaries they know where it is. They will talk about it beforehand and they know what you are comfortable with and are willing to go to bat for you every time. It's great!"</p><p class="testimonial-author">- Chloe</p><div class="client-testimonial"><p><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1044709102&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true"></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="testimonial-text">"They were really good about sending emails and calling. We had been trying with another realtor and then he moved to Florida. We knew a couple of people that were realtors. We thought well you know Sandy seemed to be like she would be a good fit this time. I said, "Let's go ahead and try Sandy and see how she does". She got us a place because nowadays it's awful. You know you put a bid on a house and you have a limit and there's a bidding war and it goes up $50,000 sometimes. You can't get what you want. So this was a very good thing for us and for the people that were selling the home. They didn't even have to put it on the market it was one of those things."</p><p class="testimonial-author">- Beth</p><div class="client-testimonial"><p><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1042510030&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true"></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="testimonial-text">"They walked me through every step of the way and answered all of my questions. I pretty much walked in with no knowledge of how any of it worked. They came up with everything, they even got me connected with my mortgage broker who was also amazing. They essentially said, "Hey here's the list of things to do." I got it done and it made it super simple."</p><p class="testimonial-author">- Brenna</p><div class="client-testimonial"><p><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1033114432&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true"></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="testimonial-text">"They were with us the whole way. By the way, we knew Sandy when Hank was in real estate so she's an old friend as well as a realtor. I thought it was fantastic, she did really a good job. You know that was during COVID and she couldn't bring buyers in to see the house because Hank tested positive two different times. So nobody wanted to come in the house so she did a virtual tour. And it was through that process that the people who bought it liked it and they won it. It was over the top, it was just really great."</p><p class="testimonial-author">- Mary</p><div class="client-testimonial"><p><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1022589736&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true"></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="testimonial-text">"She kind of interviews you before you put your house on the market. She comes to the house, she did a Facebook Live. You can set up appointments from that. I was kind of in control of that but they watched if I got a request and I didn't see it right away. They made sure to contact me. They were totally in the loop with everything. They're pretty transparent. They send you a list of what's going to happen and what to expect. I thought they did a good job for me, I was pleased with everything that happened."</p><p class="testimonial-author">- Jeanette</p><div class="client-testimonial"><p><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1011333577&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true"></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="testimonial-text">"They actually prepared us really well. We kind of were worried going into the situation but they eased our minds a lot and told us the steps that we needed to take. It was probably the smoothest process ever. She really just worked on our behalf to get us the best possible outcome. I was able to completely trust her and that she was going to get everything done for us. I had no issues that came about at all."</p><p class="testimonial-author">- Ariel</p><div class="client-testimonial"><p><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/995649865&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true"></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="testimonial-text">"They would just call me to have any ideas of where certain costs would be and where we wouldn't budge. There was definitely a lot of back and forth with the budget but it wasn't anything that was crazy. They were very open about all the communication. It was the first time I ever experienced purchasing a home from somebody else. It felt like it took longer but that's not through any part of them. It was more like just the loan process. What Sandy was doing was great she was very communicative. She was very positive. She gave us a lot of cards and handwritten notes. She was really nice."</p><p class="testimonial-author">- Alex</p><div class="client-testimonial"><p><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/988024546&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true"></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="testimonial-text">"So we've been through the process before and we just kind of went into it knowing what was going to happen. She asked us questions like "Have you ever done this?" "Do you know the steps?". Anytime we did have questions she was right there to answer them. Everyone was so nice and so helpful. We were really nervous because the market here is very, very, very competitive. And they answered every little anxious question I had. It was a very smooth process. Once we got an offer accepted everything went really quick."</p><p class="testimonial-author">- Lisa</p><div class="client-testimonial"><p><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/966298324&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true"></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="testimonial-text">"They provided me a list and I talked to Sandy and Team several times throughout the process with all of my detailed questions. The results would be she showed me several, several, homes probably 20. And anytime I would find one or she would send me one and I would ask to add one or two or three more showings throughout the day we would make it all work. I really appreciated the fact that you know she would squeeze in that time to do that because I was on the hunt to get something very quickly and she made that happen."</p><p class="testimonial-author">- Donna</p><div class="client-testimonial"><p><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/947459818&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true"></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="testimonial-text">"It was pretty spectacular. I'll also give the caveat on all of this, she's my mom. So she very well already knew everything I wanted. And was able to pretty quickly get everything done with very little input from me other than here's my money."</p><p class="testimonial-author">- Tony</p><div class="client-testimonial"><p><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/945183634&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true"></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="testimonial-text">"She walked through everything with me as far as the sale but she sold another house for us too. It all happened quick I mean she's a hustler. She gets out there and does what she needs to do and gets it done. I wouldn't hire anyone else, she's great."</p><p class="testimonial-author">- Marlene</p><div class="client-testimonial"><p><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/932170756&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true"></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="testimonial-text">"Sandy was really upfront the whole time. She laid it out pretty bare from the get-go about what she was going to do and how she was going to do it. I don't feel like she ever strayed from what she told us. When we first started discussing it I felt immediately reassured. The whole process was way less stressful just because of how Sandy started the process just by telling us what was going on up front. Everybody on the team that I dealt with was just again straight upfront telling us exactly what we needed to do when we needed to do it or what they were going to do for us and what was going to happen. Everything was communicated quickly and efficiently. I didn't have any questions about any of it because it was all clear just straight from the get-go. And if I did have a question it was responded to as fast as possible and the answer was satisfactory."</p><p class="testimonial-author">- Steven</p><div class="client-testimonial"><p><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/922643518&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true"></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="testimonial-text">"We ended up purchasing a house. Something that we really wanted, something close to where we were looking in our budget. Enough room for us to grow our family. Sandy was very nice and very accommodating and flexible with our schedule. And with everything going on she helped us out a lot. We had interviews before we chose a realtor. They had a bunch of guides to help us. Just a lot of information that they gave us we that we were able to read through and prepare for it."</p><p class="testimonial-author">- Mandeep</p><div class="client-testimonial"><p><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/919119838&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true"></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="testimonial-text">"Sandy is very well organized and definitely laid it out in front of us what we would be expecting as far as people she was going to contact, people we would need to contact, and things we would need to provide them. She definitely let us know in advance if there would be turbulence just because it's the nature of the business. And in fact, there was turbulence but she handled it for us pretty well. Mostly all we did was just say "Hey Sandy is something going on?" She would call all of the people and get all of the information and get back to us we didn't really have to do a lot more than that. But as always Sandy is absolutely amazing. She has worked for us before in the past. She's been our family person for real estate for the past 20 years. So I would say she did amazing at preparing us for what was coming."</p><p class="testimonial-author">- Jim</p><div class="client-testimonial"><p><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/905735617&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true"></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="testimonial-text">"They did fantastic. It was very structured which is something I like. So it was a pretty quick sell. Actually, go back because we actually bought the house with that same team back in 2015 or 2016. They were good to deal with there when we were negotiating from the buyer perspective. When we sold it was great there too. Pretty much with the way the market is right now they lined us out with what we could probably expect. Everything actually happened exactly the way they had projected it. We had five offers in three days. There was a very thorough outline and comparison on those offers which made it a very factual-based decision. They did a great job they were very organized and structured and I appreciated it."</p><p class="testimonial-author">- Adam</p><div class="client-testimonial"><p><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/881958196&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true"></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="testimonial-text">"She was very helpful for me because this was the first home that I've sold for someone, actually, it was for my parents. I contacted her and she came through kind of talked to me let me know what I should fix and what I wouldn't have to do. She was just very helpful throughout the whole process. She would check in with me and she was always available when I needed to talk to her. I will use her again probably in the future."</p><p class="testimonial-author">- Wiley</p><div class="client-testimonial"><p><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/881958196&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true"></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="testimonial-text">"I think she did an amazing job honestly. She was very informative like what to expect and everything. I think her guidance was really good on the whole process. I think she exceeded my expectations. She was pretty willing to go anywhere I wanted to go. We first started out in Snohomish County, Everet, then Marysville kind of looking in that area then we noticed how competitive it was. So she actually suggested that we go 70 miles from her office to look at houses and she didn't hesitate at all. She made time to go down there on Saturday and i was actually very appreciative. When I did get the house and started packing she actually provided me moving boxes. There's no way she needed to do that but that's what she does."</p><p class="testimonial-author">- Dave</p><div class="client-testimonial"><p><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/849076570&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true"></iframe></p><p class="testimonial-text">"Our house was well prepped [by Sandy] and prepared to sell our house. I understood [from Sandy] how the [texting] system worked as far as making the appointments and stuff therefore I had a lot of appointments the three days that it took to sell my house. If I had any questions I'd just call and ask Sandy or if she needed something done she let us know. It was a wonderful experience."</p><p class="testimonial-author">- Aretta</p><div class="client-testimonial"><p><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/840611932&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true"></iframe></p><p class="testimonial-text">C - "How did the team prepare you for what to expect during the process?" S - "Very good and my expectation was total." C - "How would you describe the team's overall technique and communication level when negotiating on your behalf?" S - "They were professional." C - "On a scale of one to 10, how likely are you to refer Sandy and Company to a friend or family member?" S - "Oh that's a 10.

They worked together so they communicate well with each other to be able to communicate with me as their client I just feel like they did a really good job. I think both Sandy and her assistants are really great especially as you know like I just said communication is really important and she's very good at that and also very good at giving advice. Both my husband and I had been real estate agents years ago so I guess we have a tendency to be a little more picky but Sandy really offered great advice for us and we followed it."</p><p class="testimonial-author">- Christie</p><div class="client-testimonial"><p><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/823751992&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true"></iframe></p><p class="testimonial-text">"She's very thorough.

Sandy let me know right up front how things were going to go. Sandy was able to get what she thought was fair but also possible for me. She was real but also tried to work in my benefit as much as possible. Whenever I had questions Sandy was right there to help me out."</p><p class="testimonial-author">- Jason</p><div class="client-testimonial"><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/767589946&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true"></iframe><p class="testimonial-text">"She basically just narrowed in on exactly what I wanted. I just wanted a place that wasn't gigantic. Something around 850 square feet. And I ended up in this place and I really like it it's nice. The process was super easy and Sandy is always great so I have no complaints or anything it was pretty smooth. Sandy always you know wants to make sure I get the best deal so trust her implicitly."</p><p class="testimonial-author">- Erinn</p><div class="client-testimonial"><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/554183412&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true"></iframe><p class="testimonial-text">"She has a lot of experience. She's also very hard-working. She took the ferry because the property I did end up buying was on the Olympic Peninsula, so she had to take the ferry over there a couple of times. She even met the inspector, and after the repairs were done she went back there and had to take another ferry. What I expected, she went over and above.

She's great, very helpful. After talking to us for a little bit, she pretty much knew what we were looking for, and the nice thing was that every time something came on the market that was what we were kind of looking for, I'd say "yea" or "nay."

When we moved here, we were going to move in with my children, but at first, I wanted to go back to Washington because Arizona is too hot.

We were actually out of town when we put the house on the market and my neighborhood is a really friendly neighborhood and my neighbor below me, after we put the house on the market, she thought someone had broken in. Some kids. So she had called the police while I was in Colorado, my house is in Washington state. And Sandy took over and because she had a key to the house and could let the police in and everything. She came down and went out of her way to make sure everything was safe and secure and it turned out to be a false alarm which was great. But I have to give her absolute kudos for going above and beyond and coming down and opening my house up for the police that night. She&rsquo;s available, available, available! For questions, for answers, for getting together, she came over several times when I had questions. I would say she is wise in her assessment of what a house could be on the market for. But I think she just had her thumb on the pulse of the market while our house was on the market. I really appreciated that because I&rsquo;d been in that house for over 20 years. She&rsquo;s a wonderful woman, I really, really enjoyed working with her. I really appreciated that I could contact her either in text message, or over the phone or email, it didn&rsquo;t matter.

This was 8 or 9 months ago, probably May, June, or July. I wanted to move before the school year started because I have children. What ended up happening was she showed me probably a dozen or more homes. We&rsquo;d go see 3 or 4 houses. We went around my normal area. We went as far as Issaquah to look at homes all over the area. She sat down with me several times and there just wasn&rsquo;t anything that was right, that really fit my family&rsquo;s needs. Everything we saw wasn&rsquo;t quite right. I really backed off for the winter and then I decided that I wanted to get really serious about it again. I called Sandy, I&rsquo;d been in touch with her ever since then, sending emails back and forth just really trying to find the right home. And we finally settled. We saw three homes&hellip;we saw one house and it was almost. The next home we saw was perfect. We saw one more home but we were deciding on the offer we were going to make on the previous home in the kitchen of the last home that we were looking at. It just really clicked and that was the right one and Sandy helped us through the process. We went back and forth with the inspection and the whole process was just great. We ended up buying and now I am currently trying to sell my next home and she&rsquo;s already come over and walked us through and talked about where I need to be. I&rsquo;m looking to put it up on the market next week some time. She tolerated all of my nonsense and just attitude and she was just extremely patient and just worked with me...She&rsquo;s level-headed and professional even though I&rsquo;m not. She was really, really patient with the whole process.

That was on a Thursday and we had all the offers that we needed by Saturday. What more can I say. I was hysterical because I didn&rsquo;t expect it to happen that fast. She was very calming to me because I really was [hysterical]. I thought I&rsquo;d have a couple weeks or something, I didn&rsquo;t expect to have an offer in two days. She not only calmed me, she had an open house. You know I was saying let&rsquo;s forget the open house and she said no, this can make the difference between the listing price or less. So I said okay, fine. In order to prep the house she had equipment that I could borrow that was so very necessary such as a power washer, a rug cleaner. This woman is on the ball.

We looked at so many I was worried about Sandy giving up on us. She never did at all. We finally found "the house" and Sandy negotiated a great deal for us. The very night we signed the agreement the winds came up and blew not one but three trees down on the house destroying much of the upper level. Sandy was out there with us every step again and when it became apparent the repair project would not meet our time frame needs, it was off to look at more houses. I just knew now she had to be sick of us and would send us on our way to find another agent, but not a chance. With the same care and energy from day one she set out to find us a great home. After many more appointments and miles and miles of travel for Sandy and her team, we found an even better home in a beautiful location with plenty of room and trees to enjoy for years to come. I am amazed that Sandy always had the same big smile and enthusiasm at each property we viewed and I believe that that through all this journey to find our home we were so very lucky to have come across Sandy Eagon."</p><p class="testimonial-author">- John.

It wasn't like it was a lot of information, but it was exactly what we needed because we had no idea what we were doing. This was the first time we bought a house.

It made me feel good.&rdquo;</p><p class="testimonial-author">- Jodi</p><hr /><div class="client-testimonial"><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/251865672&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe><p class="testimonial-text">&ldquo;We had been trying to sell our house with a different agent. [Then] we got Sandy. Very much of a go getter and which was appreciated because my husband and I didn&rsquo;t have a whole lot of time to set up things like open houses and what not. I mean she did a lot of work setting up open houses and marketing it. [She] had a great photographer come in. If something needed to be checked at the house, my husband and I were both out of the house for a time, and sometimes we&rsquo;d need a quick turnaround on looking at something and we wouldn&rsquo;t be able to make it up and so she&rsquo;d actually go over and handle it. Like I think there were a couple times she took the garbage can down from the road. Which I wasn&rsquo;t even expecting her to do that. But that was fantastic. We had a question of the square footage and she actually went over and measured the whole house and you know did a quick estimate there just to do a quick sanity check. So that was really good.&rdquo;</p><p class="testimonial-author">- Genevieve</p><hr /><div class="client-testimonial"><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/242784708&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe><p class="testimonial-text">&ldquo;She was really responsive and prompt and pleasant and friendly and helpful.

We were going to see some houses that she had listed that she found for us to look at and on the way my wife saw an open house. We stopped, we liked that place and it wasn&rsquo;t listed with Sandy, we told her about it and she said would you like to make an offer, we made an offer and she coordinated the whole thing with the other realtor and we ended up getting the house and it was fantastic for us throughout the whole process. She was available night and day no matter what time or always willing to listen to our questions, was very responsive, text, email, or by phone [we] could always get ahold of her or she would be calling us back or contacting us right away whenever we had any type of questions, concerns, or misunderstandings.
