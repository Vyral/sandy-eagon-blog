<p class="testimonial-text">“I’d been wanting to move for a long time and I always put it off and I finally just got to the point where I had to get something bigger. My family needed a bigger home. I went to my banker, I got myself a pre-approval letter, and he suggested Sandy. So I made an appointment and went and saw her and started looking at homes. This was 8 or 9 months ago, probably May, June, or July. I wanted to move before the school year started because I have children. What ended up happening was she showed me probably a dozen or more homes. We’d go see 3 or 4 houses. We went around my normal area. We went as far as Issaquah to look at homes all over the area. She sat down with me several times and there just wasn’t anything that was right, that really fit my family’s needs. Everything we saw wasn’t quite right. I really backed off for the winter and then I decided that I wanted to get really serious about it again. I called Sandy, I’d been in touch with her ever since then, sending emails back and forth just really trying to find the right home. And we finally settled. We saw three homes…we saw one house and it was almost. The next home we saw was perfect. We saw one more home but we were deciding on the offer we were going to make on the previous home in the kitchen of the last home that we were looking at. It just really clicked and that was the right one and Sandy helped us through the process. We went back and forth with the inspection and the whole process was just great. We ended up buying and now I am currently trying to sell my next home and she’s already come over and walked us through and talked about where I need to be. I’m looking to put it up on the market next week some time. She tolerated all of my nonsense and just attitude and she was just extremely patient and just worked with me...She’s level-headed and professional even though I’m not. She was really, really patient with the whole process. You have to know me, but when I say, “Hey, somebody actually got along with me and tolerated me for this long!” One friend I recommended her to, my friend told me that we should give her a medal for her efforts!”</p>

<p class="testimonial-text">“She was very easy to work with, very professional and it ended in purchasing our home. She regularly went above and beyond, I just got a sense that she was very in tune with her job and she was always giving us helpful advice.”</p>

<p class="testimonial-text">“When I wanted to put my house up for sale, I knew that Sandy was familiar with the neighborhood. She listed it and within four days it was sold. I was very happy with the quick work that she did for me. It was good. She always works good, she always does above what she needs to do. Everything that Sandy does it just seems like it is top, top notch. I would recommend her to anybody.”</p>

<p class="testimonial-text">“Well the results were fantastic. She guided me through the whole process, she was there when I got crazy and helped me. I can’t say enough about her. I’m very pleased with everything she did for me and she was right there all the time doing what had to be done and keeping me informed. I’m very satisfied with her. You know buying a house is so confusing, but she was right there with all the answers and guiding me through it, and just the whole thing. She’s always there. And that’s what I like about her, and she tells you up front what it is, what’s going on, how it’s going to happen. I’ve bought houses before and it’s never been this easy. I mean I’m not saying it was perfectly easy because there’s always things that the lenders do, but she was always right there for me."</P>

<p class="testimonial-text">'“I thought she went beyond my expectation as far as working on our behalf. I was very pleased with the way she was able to act as a go-between between ourselves and the builder. She was effective and she put forth more effort than most people would usually do, so I was very pleased. And she was easy to work with, with us. I was really glad to have her as my Realtor. The builder made a commitment to us that he later reneged on and she took it upon herself to write a request explaining our particular difficult situation that he would reconsider. And they did try to reconsider and do what they could to help us out. I don’t think that would have happened if she hadn’t stuck her neck out for us."</p>

<p class="testimonial-text">"I’ve worked with Sandy before so I had utter confidence in what she suggested as a listing price. When she listed it I signed the papers and two seconds later the sign went up and about an hour and a half later I can’t even begin to tell you how many agents walked in with their clients. That was on a Thursday and we had all the offers that we needed by Saturday. What more can I say. I was hysterical because I didn’t expect it to happen that fast. She was very calming to me because I really was [hysterical]. I thought I’d have a couple weeks or something, I didn’t expect to have an offer in two days. She not only calmed me, she had an open house.  You know I was saying let’s forget the open house and she said no, this can make the difference between the listing price or less. So I said okay, fine. In order to prep the house she had equipment that I could borrow that was so very necessary such as a power washer, a rug cleaner. This woman is on the ball. I will tell you at the close of sale things went a little screwy and she knocked herself to make things right for me. I can’t praise her enough."</p>

<p class="testimonial-text">"She was very pleasant and she did a fantastic job for us, we were very, very pleased with her. I’ve lived in the same house for like 27 years so I haven’t dealt with very many Realtors, but I know quite a few and she was just very pleasant, we enjoyed working with her. She did a good job for us." </P>
